## 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

### ciceritos
The image is bad the recipe wrong. Chicharos are peas! Chicharitos are green peas...

מטגנים בצל
מוסיפים: כרכום, פלפל לבן, מרק עוף ומלח
מוסיפים את הציצריטוס ומים ומבשלים.
כשמטגנים את הבצל אפשר לטגן ועדיף יותר נכון גם סלרי כי זה נותן לזה יותר טעם טוב.

## 🟡 NORMAL PRIORITY

### adafina
- No need the parenthesis in AR/EN/SP "(Estofado de Shabat Marroquí)", just Adafina
- Not for "Lunch", it's for traditional meal in the morning of Shabbat.

### adafinawheatside_dish
- In Spanish just call it "Trigo", in English "Wheat Berries" and the name in Tunisian Arabic also correct.
- There is nothing special that makes it Vegan, no need to say "בגרסה טבעונית זו קולים"
- Talk about the word Trigo and Hita, not Adafina!

### artichokemushroomsstew
- Remove "Gannariya" as it is not in the original dish name.
- Just say that in our house it is a popular Shabbat dish.
- It is not Djerba, this is from Enny's side... Tangier...

### bakedpotatolevivot
- It's not Ma'akouda
- Chickpea flour is not needed
- Instead of talking about Ma'akouda, say that is AKA Latkes (comes from Yiddish, originating from East Slavic words like Ukrainian oladka or Russian latka, meaning "small fried pancake" or "patch")

### banana_cake
- The vegan version is not with ריוויון but simple apple sauce, why did you lie
- No need to explain in the title what "cake" or עוגה is!

- Just say that Judy is a name of friend that gave us the recipe...

### chickenfricasseestew

### honeycakemami
- מאמי is for the name for mom in English!
- It's just Mom's honey cake (Enny's mom)

### marmouma
