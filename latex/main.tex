This cookbook represents a bridge between generations, cultures, and culinary traditions. It honors the rich heritage of North African Jewish cuisine while embracing modern plant-based living.

Our family's culinary journey spans from the ancient island of Djerba in Tunisia to the vibrant port city of Tangier in Morocco. Through the recipes of Ruth Cohen-Trabelsi and the Kadoch-Muyal family line, we preserve not just dishes, but stories, memories, and cultural identity.

Each recipe has been carefully researched and adapted to be completely plant-based while maintaining the authentic flavors and cultural significance that have been passed down through generations.

\begin{culturalcontext}
This cookbook is presented in four languages: English, Hebrew (עברית), Spanish (Español), and Tunisian Arabic (تونسي) with Hebrew transliteration, reflecting the multicultural heritage of our family and the diaspora communities that preserved these traditions.
