# Vegan Couscous (קוסקוס) Recipe

Couscous is a beloved staple in North African cuisine, particularly within the Tunisian Jewish community of Djerba. This dish symbolizes cultural heritage and tradition, representing a connection to family and history.

## Ingredients
1. 1 cup fine semolina (סולת)
2. 1 cup vegetable broth (or water)
3. 1 cup cooked chickpeas (חומוס)
4. 2 medium carrots (גזר), diced
5. 1 medium zucchini (קישוא), diced
6. 1 small pumpkin (דלעת), diced
7. 2 tablespoons olive oil (שמן זית)
8. 1 teaspoon salt (מלח)
9. 1 teaspoon ground cumin (קימל)
10. Fresh parsley (פטרוזיליה) for garnish

## Instructions
1. **Prepare the Couscous:** In a large bowl, combine the fine semolina and salt. Gradually pour in 1 cup of vegetable broth (or water) while stirring. Let it sit for 10 minutes to absorb the liquid.
2. **Steam the Couscous:** Place a steamer basket over a pot of boiling water. Fluff the soaked semolina with a fork and transfer it to the steamer. Steam for about 15-20 minutes until fluffy.
3. **Cook the Vegetables:** In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced carrots, zucchini, and pumpkin. Sauté for about 10 minutes until they begin to soften.
4. **Add Chickpeas and Spices:** Stir in the cooked chickpeas and ground cumin. Cook for another 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. If needed, add a splash of vegetable broth to keep the mixture moist.
5. **Combine and Serve:** Once the couscous is steamed, fluff it again with a fork. Serve the vegetable mixture over the couscous, garnished with fresh parsley.

## Serving Suggestions
Serve the couscous on a large platter for a communal dining experience. Drizzle with additional olive oil and sprinkle with more fresh parsley before serving.
