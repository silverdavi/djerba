  (Traditional source of protein.)
  
- **6 cups rich vegetable broth**  
  (Homemade or store-bought; enhances flavor.)

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Sauté Aromatics**: In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until it becomes translucent, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and sauté for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

2. **Toast Spices**: Add the ground cumin, coriander, turmeric, and ginger to the pot. Stir well and toast the spices for about 1 minute to release their flavors.

3. **Add Vegetables**: Incorporate the diced carrots, zucchini, potato, pumpkin, and chopped tomatoes into the pot. Stir to combine and cook for about 5 minutes, allowing the vegetables to soften slightly.

4. **Add Broth and Chickpeas**: Pour in the vegetable broth and add the chickpeas. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.

5. **Season and Adjust**: Taste the soup and season with salt, pepper, and harissa to your desired heat level. If using, stir in the coconut milk for added creaminess.

6. **Finish with Lemon**: Just before serving, stir in the fresh lemon juice for brightness.

7. **Prepare Couscous**: While the soup simmers, prepare couscous according to package instructions or steam it traditionally in a couscoussier. Fluff the couscous well after cooking.

8. **Serve**: In a bowl, place a generous serving of couscous and ladle the vegetable soup over it. Garnish with fresh cilantro or parsley.
