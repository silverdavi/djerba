## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Prepare the Chickpeas:** If using dried chickpeas, soak them overnight in plenty of water. Drain and rinse before using.
2. **Sauté Aromatics:** In a large heavy pot or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add diced onions and sauté until translucent (about 5 minutes). Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
3. **Incorporate Vegetables:** Add the diced carrots and potatoes to the pot. Sauté for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. **Add Mushrooms and Tofu:** Stir in the diced mushrooms and cubed tofu. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, allowing the mushrooms to release moisture.
5. **Spice Mixture:** Sprinkle in the cumin, coriander, caraway, and harissa. Stir well to coat the vegetables and tofu with the spices.
6. **Add Legumes and Broth:** Incorporate the soaked chickpeas, lentils, and vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. 
7. **Simmer:** Cover the pot and let it simmer for at least 1.5 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally. If the mixture becomes too thick, add more broth or water as needed.
8. **Finish with Greens:** About 15 minutes before serving, stir in the chopped spinach or Swiss chard and allow it to wilt. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste, and add nutritional yeast if desired.
9. **Serve:** Remove from heat and let it sit for a few minutes. The flavors will deepen as it cools slightly.
