# Vegan Semolina Soup (שמיד - Shamid)

## Ingredient List
- **Semolina** (סולת) - Essential ingredient; **retain**.
- **Onions** (בצל) - Adds sweetness and depth; **retain**.
- **Paprika** (פפריקה) - Key spice for flavor and color; **retain**.
- **Olive Oil** (שמן זית) - For sautéing; use **extra virgin olive oil**.
- **Vegetable Broth** (ציר ירקות) - Liquid base; **use rich vegetable broth**.
- **Textured Vegetable Protein (TVP)** (חלבון צמחי טקסטורה) - For protein and umami; **substitute for meat**.
- **Mushrooms** (פטריות) - Chopped, for umami; **substitute for meat**.
- **Lentils** (עדשים) - Optional, for heartiness; **substitute for meat**.
- **Preserved Lemons** (לימונים משומרים) - For brightness; optional.
- **Capers** (קפרס) - For a salty, briny flavor; optional.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Toast the Semolina:** In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add 1 cup of semolina and toast, stirring constantly, until it turns lightly golden (about 5-7 minutes). Remove from heat and set aside.
   
2. **Caramelize the Onions:** In the same pot, add another tablespoon of olive oil. Add 1 large finely chopped onion and sauté over low heat until deeply caramelized (about 15-20 minutes). Stir occasionally to prevent burning.

3. **Add Spices:** Once the onions are caramelized, add 1-2 teaspoons of paprika, stirring for the last few minutes of cooking to bloom the flavors.

4. **Combine Ingredients:** Slowly add 4 cups of vegetable broth to the onion mixture. Stir in the toasted semolina. Bring to a gentle simmer.

5. **Choose Your Protein:** If using TVP, rehydrate according to package instructions and add during the last 10 minutes of cooking. If using lentils, cook them separately until soft and stir them in at the end. Sauté chopped mushrooms in a separate pan and add them to the soup for extra texture and umami.

6. **Simmer and Thicken:** Let the soup simmer gently for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally until the semolina is cooked through and the soup has thickened to your desired consistency.

7. **Enhance Flavor:** If desired, finely chop preserved lemons and capers, adding them to the soup for brightness and saltiness. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.

8. **Serve:** Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with a drizzle of olive oil and fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro if desired. Serve with a dollop of vegan harissa on the side for a spicy kick.
