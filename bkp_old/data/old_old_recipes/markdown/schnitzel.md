# Vegan Schnitzel (שניצל)

## Cultural Background
Schnitzel (שניצל) has found its way into the culinary repertoire of the Tunisian Jewish community, particularly in Djerba, as a modern adaptation influenced by European Jewish immigrants. While it is not a traditional dish for the Sabbath or holidays, it is often enjoyed as a main course (עיקרית) during everyday meals and festive occasions, embodying the dynamic cultural exchange within North African Jewish cuisine.

## Ingredient List

- **Main Protein:**
  - 14 oz (400g) Pressed & Frozen Tofu (or Cooked Corn Kernels, Chickpeas, or Fava Beans)
    - *Substitution Note:* Tofu provides a similar texture to meat when pressed and frozen. Legumes are a great alternative for added protein and fiber.

- **Binding Agents:**
  - 1/2 cup Plant-based Milk (such as almond or soy)
  - 1 tablespoon Dijon Mustard
    - *Substitution Note:* Aquafaba (chickpea brine) can also be used as a binding agent.

- **Coating:**
  - 1 cup Breadcrumbs (or crushed cornflakes for gluten-free)
  - 1/4 cup Chickpea Flour (optional, for extra crunch)

- **Seasoning:**
  - 1 teaspoon Turmeric
  - 1 teaspoon Smoked Salt
  - 1 teaspoon Cumin
  - 1 teaspoon Coriander
  - 1 tablespoon Harissa (adjust to taste for spiciness)

- **Frying Oil:**
  - Olive Oil, Canola Oil, or Peanut Oil (for frying)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Prepare the Tofu:**
   - Press the tofu for at least 30 minutes to remove excess moisture. Wrap it in a clean kitchen towel and place a weight on top.
   - Once pressed, freeze the tofu for a few hours. Thaw and press again to achieve a firmer texture.

2. **Marinate the Tofu:**
   - Cut the tofu into thin slices (about 1/4 inch thick).
   - In a bowl, mix the plant-based milk, Dijon mustard, turmeric, smoked salt, cumin, coriander, and harissa. 
   - Marinate the tofu slices in this mixture for at least 30 minutes.

3. **Set Up the Breading Station:**
   - Prepare three shallow plates: one with flour (or chickpea flour), one with the marinated tofu, and one with breadcrumbs (or crushed cornflakes).

4. **Bread the Tofu:**
   - Dredge each marinated tofu slice in the flour first, shaking off any excess. 
   - Dip it back into the marinade, allowing any excess to drip off.
   - Finally, coat the tofu slice in breadcrumbs, pressing lightly to adhere.

5. **Fry the Schnitzels:**
   - Heat enough oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat to cover the bottom of the pan.
   - Fry the breaded tofu slices in batches for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Remove and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.

6. **Serve:**
   - Serve the vegan schnitzels hot, garnished with fresh herbs if desired.

## Serving Suggestions
Pair the vegan schnitzel with traditional Tunisian sides like mashed potatoes, a fresh salad, or a harissa-based sauce. It can also be served alongside pickled vegetables for a flavorful contrast.
