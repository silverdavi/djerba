# Vegan Bonotaz (בונוטאז)

## Cultural Background
Bonotaz is a traditional dish from Tunisian Jewish cuisine, particularly associated with the Djerba community. This savory dish is typically served as a first course (ראשונה, *Rishona*) during Shabbat breakfast (שבת בבוקר, *Shabbat Boker*). It reflects a blend of Mizrahi and Sephardic culinary influences, showcasing the rich cultural heritage of the Jewish community in Tunisia, especially the Silver-Cohen-Trabelsi family.

## Ingredient List
- **2 tbsp olive oil** (traditional fat source)
- **1 large onion, chopped**
- **4 cloves garlic, minced**
- **1 red bell pepper, chopped**
- **1 yellow bell pepper, chopped**
- **1 eggplant, diced**
- **1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes**
- **1 cup cooked chickpeas** (or butter beans or lentils as substitutes)
- **2 tbsp harissa paste** (adjust to taste; ensure it's vegan)
- **2 tsp ground cumin**
- **2 tsp ground coriander**
- **1 tsp smoked paprika**
- **4 cups vegetable broth** (substituting chicken broth)
- **1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro and parsley**
- **Salt and pepper to taste**
- **Optional:** 1 preserved lemon, finely chopped (for added tang)
- **Optional:** Toasted almonds or pine nuts for garnish

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Sauté Aromatics:** Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
   
2. **Add Vegetables:** Incorporate the chopped red and yellow bell peppers and diced eggplant into the pot. Cook for an additional 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are slightly softened.

3. **Add Spices and Tomato:** Stir in the harissa paste, ground cumin, ground coriander, and smoked paprika. Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly to toast the spices. Then, add the crushed tomatoes and allow to simmer for another 5 minutes.

4. **Add Legumes and Broth:** Mix in the cooked chickpeas (or your choice of legumes) and pour in the vegetable broth. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for at least 1 hour. For deeper flavor, consider simmering it longer or overnight in a slow cooker.

5. **Adjust Seasoning:** Taste the Bonotaz and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.

6. **Add Herbs and Garnish:** Stir in the chopped fresh cilantro and parsley. If using, add the finely chopped preserved lemon for an extra layer of flavor.

7. **Serve:** Serve the Bonotaz warm, garnished with toasted almonds or pine nuts if desired. Pair it with pita bread or laffa for dipping.
