# Vegan Mhamsa (מחמסה)

## Cultural Background
Mhamsa (מחמסה) is a cherished pasta dish from the Jewish community of Djerba, Tunisia. This dish represents a beautiful blend of North African culinary traditions and Jewish heritage, often prepared for family gatherings and religious observances. With its roots in the Silver-Cohen-Trabelsi family, Mhamsa symbolizes cultural identity and the adaptation of regional flavors into a beloved vegan version that honors tradition.

## Ingredients
- **Ptitim (פתיתים)** - 1 cup (Israeli pearl couscous)
- **Plant-based Sausages (נקניקיות)** - 2-3 (made from seitan, soy, or pea protein) or 2 cups diced hearty mushrooms (e.g., cremini)
- **Rich Vegetable Broth** - 4 cups (spiced with traditional North African spices)
- **Olive Oil** - 2 tablespoons (or Argan oil)
- **Onion** - 1 large, diced
- **Garlic** - 3 cloves, minced
- **Carrots** - 2, diced
- **Bell Pepper** - 1, diced
- **Spinach or Swiss Chard** - 2 cups, chopped
- **Cumin** - 1 teaspoon
- **Coriander** - 1 teaspoon
- **Turmeric** - 1/2 teaspoon
- **Smoked Paprika** - 1/2 teaspoon
- **Preserved Lemon (לימון מוחמץ)** - 1, rind finely chopped
- **Olives (זיתים)** - 1/2 cup, sliced (green or black)
- **Salt and Pepper** - to taste
- **Fresh Herbs (Cilantro or Parsley)** - for garnish

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Prepare the Broth**: In a large pot, bring 4 cups of vegetable broth to a gentle simmer. Add cumin, coriander, turmeric, and smoked paprika to infuse the broth with flavor.
   
2. **Sauté the Vegetables**: In a separate skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add diced onions and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic, diced carrots, and bell pepper, cooking for an additional 5-7 minutes until softened.

3. **Add Sausages or Mushrooms**: If using plant-based sausages, slice them into rounds and add them to the skillet. If using mushrooms, add them diced at this stage. Sauté until browned, about 5-8 minutes.

4. **Incorporate Ptitim**: Add the ptitim (פתיתים) to the skillet, stirring to combine with the vegetables and sausage/mushroom mixture. 

5. **Combine with Broth**: Pour the spiced vegetable broth over the mixture in the skillet. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cover. Simmer on low for about 15-20 minutes until the ptitim is cooked and has absorbed most of the liquid.

6. **Add Greens and Flavors**: Stir in chopped spinach or Swiss chard, preserved lemon rind, and olives. Cook for an additional 5 minutes until the greens are wilted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

7. **Serve**: Garnish the Mhamsa with fresh herbs, and if desired, additional preserved lemon slices for extra flavor. Serve warm as a hearty meal.
