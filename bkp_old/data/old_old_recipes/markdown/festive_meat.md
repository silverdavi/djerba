- **Dried mint** (1 tsp)
- **Paprika** (1 tsp)
- **Vegetable broth** (4 cups)
- **Chickpeas or beans** (1 can, drained; optional for added richness)
- **Flaxseed meal** (2 tbsp mixed with 6 tbsp water) (as egg replacer)

### Notes on Substitutions
- For an extra umami boost, consider adding **miso paste** or **nutritional yeast**.
- Use seasonal vegetables to add variety and freshness.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Prepare the Flax Eggs:** In a small bowl, mix the flaxseed meal with water and let it sit for about 10-15 minutes until it thickens.
   
2. **Sauté the Aromatics:** In a large pot, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onions and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.

3. **Add the Vegetables:** Stir in the sliced carrots and cubed potatoes, cooking for an additional 5-7 minutes until they begin to soften.

4. **Incorporate the Mushrooms and Greens:** Add the mushrooms and Swiss chard (or spinach) to the pot. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring until the mushrooms are tender.

5. **Spice It Up:** Sprinkle in the cumin, coriander, caraway seeds, turmeric, dried mint, and paprika. Stir well to coat the vegetables in the spices.

6. **Add Protein and Liquid:** Incorporate the seitan or TVP, chickpeas (if using), and the prepared flax mixture. Pour in the vegetable broth and add the dried seaweed (kombu). Stir to combine.

7. **Simmer the Stew:** Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and let it simmer for at least 1.5 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally. If the stew becomes too thick, add more vegetable broth as needed.

8. **Final Touches:** Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper, or additional spices as desired. Remove the dried seaweed before serving.
