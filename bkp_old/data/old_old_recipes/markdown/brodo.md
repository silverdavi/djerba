# Vegan Brodo (ברודו) Recipe

## Cultural Background
Brodo (ברודו) is a clear broth that holds a significant place in the culinary traditions of Tunisian Jews, particularly those from Djerba. This nourishing soup, known for its simplicity and purity, is traditionally served on the eve of the Sabbath, aligning with the values of modest and wholesome cooking. The recipe is a reflection of the rich cultural heritage passed down through generations, particularly within the Silver-Cohen-Trabelsi family.

## Ingredient List
- **High-Quality Vegetable Broth** (4-6 cups)
  - *Substitution Note:* Use homemade vegetable broth for the best flavor.
  
- **Root Vegetables:**
  - 2 large Carrots (peeled and chopped)
  - 1 large Celery Root (celeriac, peeled and chopped)
  - 1 Parsley Root (peeled and chopped)
  - *Substitution Note:* If unavailable, you can use parsnips.

- **Fresh Parsley** (1 cup, chopped)
  - *Substitution Note:* No substitution; essential for authenticity.

- **Olive Oil** (2 tablespoons)
  
- **Chickpeas or Butter Beans** (1 cup, canned or cooked)
  - *Substitution Note:* Any plant-based protein can work, but these are traditional choices.

- **Salt** (to taste)
  
- **Black Pepper** (to taste)
  
- **Optional Ingredients:**
  - 1 tablespoon Tomato Paste (for added depth)
  - 1-2 dried Mushrooms (such as shiitake, for umami)
  - 1 teaspoon Harissa (optional, for heat)

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Prepare the Vegetable Broth:**
   - In a large pot, combine the vegetable broth with chopped root vegetables (carrots, celery root, parsley root), and dried mushrooms if using. Bring to a boil.
   
2. **Simmer the Broth:**
   - Reduce heat and let the broth simmer uncovered for 2-3 hours, allowing the flavors to develop. If using tomato paste, add it halfway through the simmering process.

3. **Strain the Broth:**
   - After simmering, carefully strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth into a clean pot to achieve clarity. Discard the solids or reserve them for another use.

4. **Add Protein:**
   - Return the clear broth to the heat. Add the chickpeas or butter beans, and let them warm through for about 5-10 minutes.

5. **Season the Broth:**
   - Season the broth with salt and black pepper to taste. If using harissa, add it gradually, tasting as you go.

6. **Finish with Fresh Parsley:**
   - Stir in the chopped fresh parsley just before serving to maintain its vibrant color and flavor.

7. **Serve:**
   - Ladle the hot broth into bowls and drizzle with olive oil. 

## Serving Suggestions
Serve the vegan Brodo hot, accompanied by stale vegan challah (חלה) or crusty bread for dipping. A side salad with fresh greens can complement the meal, and a small bowl of harissa can be offered for those who like a bit of heat.
