# Vegan Sfenj (שפינג׳ות) Recipe

Sfenj (ספינג׳ות) are traditional Tunisian Jewish doughnuts that embody the rich culinary heritage of the Djerban Jewish community. Known for their light and airy texture, these delightful fried treats are typically enjoyed during Hanukkah or as a comforting snack. With roots tracing back over 2,000 years, sfenj represent not only a beloved food but also a celebration of family, community, and cultural preservation.

## Ingredients

### Dough:
- **3 cups all-purpose flour** (plus extra for dusting)
- **1 ½ cups warm water** (about 110°F/43°C)
- **2 teaspoons active dry yeast**
- **1 teaspoon salt**
- **1 tablespoon sugar** (optional, for slight sweetness)
- **Vegetable oil** (for frying, such as sunflower or canola)

### Topping:
- **Powdered sugar** (for dusting) or
- **Date syrup**, **agave nectar**, or **maple syrup** (for drizzling)

### Optional Flavor Enhancements:
- **1 teaspoon orange blossom water** or **½ teaspoon ground anise** (for aromatic flavor)

## Instructions

1. **Activate the Yeast**: In a small bowl, combine the warm water and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until frothy.

2. **Mix the Dough**: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Once the yeast is frothy, pour it into the flour mixture. If using, add the orange blossom water or anise at this point. Mix until a soft and slightly sticky dough forms.

3. **Knead**: Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead gently for about 5 minutes. Avoid over-kneading; the dough should remain soft and slightly tacky.

4. **First Rise**: Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.

5. **Shape the Sfenj**: Once the dough has risen, punch it down and turn it out onto a floured surface. Pinch off small portions of dough (about the size of a golf ball) and shape them into irregular rings or balls, leaving a hole in the center.

6. **Heat the Oil**: In a deep pan or fryer, heat vegetable oil to around 350°F (175°C). Make sure there is enough oil to fully submerge the sfenj.

7. **Fry the Doughnuts**: Carefully drop a few dough shapes into the hot oil, frying them until they are golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove them with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

8. **Add Toppings**: While still warm, dust the sfenj with powdered sugar or drizzle with date syrup, agave nectar, or maple syrup as desired.

## Serving Suggestions

Serve sfenj warm, accompanied by a cup of tea or coffee. They can be enjoyed plain or with a variety of sweet toppings. For a festive touch during Hanukkah, serve alongside other traditional dishes.
