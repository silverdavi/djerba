# Ktaa (קטעה): A Vegan Tunisian Jewish Dough Drop Soup

## Cultural Background
Ktaa (קטעה), which translates to "pieces" or "chunks" in Hebrew, is a traditional dish from the Djerban Jewish community of Tunisia. This dish reflects the region's culinary heritage, blending Berber, Arab, and Jewish influences into a humble yet nourishing soup. Its simplicity and heartiness make it a staple in daily meals and festive occasions, preserving the essence of a rich culinary tradition.

## Ingredient List

### For the Dough:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour (or a mix of all-purpose and semolina for texture)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup aquafaba (liquid from canned chickpeas) or 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water (let sit for 5 minutes)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Water, as needed

### For the Broth:
- 4 cups vegetable broth (homemade or store-bought)
- 1 large onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 medium carrots, diced
- 2 celery stalks, diced
- 1 teaspoon sweet paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/4 teaspoon ground caraway seeds
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- Fresh herbs (parsley or cilantro) for garnish

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Prepare the Dough:**
   - In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. 
   - In a separate bowl, whisk together the aquafaba (or flaxseed mixture), olive oil, and a few tablespoons of water.
   - Gradually add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, stirring until a dough forms. Adjust with more water if necessary to achieve a slightly sticky but workable dough.
   - Knead the dough for about 5 minutes until smooth and elastic. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.

2. **Prepare the Broth:**
   - In a large pot, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté until caramelized, about 10-15 minutes.
   - Add the minced garlic, carrots, and celery, cooking for an additional 5 minutes.
   - Stir in the sweet paprika, cumin, coriander, and caraway seeds, toasting them gently for about 1 minute to release their flavors.

3. **Combine Broth Ingredients:**
   - Pour in the vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a rolling boil. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.

4. **Cook the Dough:**
   - Once the broth is boiling, pinch off small pieces of the rested dough (about the size of a walnut) and drop them directly into the broth.
   - Cook the dough pieces for about 5-7 minutes, or until they are tender and have absorbed some broth flavor. Avoid overcrowding the pot; cook in batches if necessary.

5. **Serve:**
   - Ladle the Ktaa into bowls, garnishing with freshly chopped herbs. Serve hot.

## Serving Suggestions
Ktaa can be served as a hearty main dish or as a comforting starter. It pairs well with crusty bread or a simple salad. During family gatherings, it might be enjoyed with a spread of olives, pickles, or roasted vegetables to complement the meal.

This recipe honors the Silver-Cohen-Trabelsi family's tradition of preparing Ktaa, described as "חתיכות בצק שנזרקות למרק רותח עם פפריקה ובצל" (pieces of dough dropped into boiling soup with paprika and onion). This family context highlights the importance of preserving culinary heritage while adapting it to modern, plant-based lifestyles.
