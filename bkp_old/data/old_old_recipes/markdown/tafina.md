# Vegan Tafina (טפינה) Recipe

## Cultural Background
*Tafina* (טפינה) is a traditional Tunisian Jewish Shabbat stew, particularly cherished by the Jewish community from Djerba. This slow-cooked dish embodies the rich culinary heritage and communal spirit of the Djerban Jewish culture, often prepared to honor the Sabbath and serve as a centerpiece for family gatherings. The Silver-Cohen-Trabelsi family has passed down their unique version of this dish, blending local flavors with deep-rooted traditions.

## Ingredients
### Main Ingredients
- **1 cup chickpeas**, soaked overnight (or 1 can, drained)
- **1 cup white beans**, soaked overnight (or 1 can, drained)
- **1 cup wheat berries**, rinsed
- **2 large Portobello mushrooms**, diced
- **2 large potatoes**, peeled and cubed
- **2 large carrots**, sliced
- **1 large turnip**, peeled and cubed
- **2 cups fresh spinach** (or kale, chard, or beet greens)
- **4 large onions**, thinly sliced
- **4 cloves garlic**, minced
- **1/4 cup olive oil**
- **2 tsp ground cumin**
- **1 tsp ground turmeric**
- **1 tsp sweet paprika**
- **1-2 tsp harissa** (adjust to taste)
- **1 tsp ground coriander**
- **1 tsp ground caraway** (optional)
- **Salt and pepper to taste**
- **4 cups vegetable broth** (or water)
- **1 tbsp brown sugar** (for caramelizing onions)

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Prepare the Beans and Wheat:** If using dried chickpeas and white beans, soak them overnight in separate bowls. Rinse and drain before use. Cook the wheat berries according to package instructions until tender.

2. **Caramelize the Onions:** In a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and a pinch of salt. Cook slowly, stirring occasionally, for about 20-30 minutes until the onions are deeply caramelized. Add the brown sugar halfway through to enhance sweetness.

3. **Toast the Spices:** Once the onions are caramelized, add minced garlic, cumin, turmeric, paprika, harissa, coriander, and caraway (if using) to the pot. Stir and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to bloom the spices.

4. **Layer the Ingredients:** Add the soaked chickpeas, white beans, cooked wheat berries, potatoes, carrots, turnip, and diced Portobello mushrooms to the pot. Season with salt and pepper. Stir well to combine all ingredients.

5. **Add Liquid:** Pour in the vegetable broth (or water) until the ingredients are just covered. Bring to a simmer.

6. **Slow Cook:** Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and reduce the heat to low. Allow the stew to cook for 2-3 hours on the stovetop or transfer it to a preheated oven set at 250°F (120°C) and cook for 4-6 hours, ensuring it simmers gently.

7. **Add Greens:** About 30 minutes before serving, stir in the fresh spinach (or other greens) and adjust seasoning if necessary. Cook until the greens are wilted and tender.

8. **Serve:** Once cooked, remove from heat and let it sit for a few minutes. Serve hot, traditionally with couscous or crusty bread.
