# Vegan Brik (בריקות)

## Cultural Background
Brik (בריקות) is a cherished Tunisian Jewish delicacy, traditionally made with thin pastry known as *warqa* (ورقة) that envelops a savory filling. It has deep historical roots within the Tunisian Jewish community, particularly in Djerba, where it symbolizes both communal and familial connections during festive occasions and everyday meals.

## Ingredient List

### For the Pastry:
- **Warqa or Malsouka pastry (ورقة ملسوقة)**
  - **Substitution:** Filo dough (ensure it's vegan)

### For the Filling:
- **2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed** (for mashed filling)
- **1 cup cooked chickpeas** (or 1 cup crumbled firm tofu)
  - **Substitution:** Spiced mashed sweet potato for a different flavor profile
- **1 tablespoon olive oil**
- **2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped** (or fresh mint)
- **1 tablespoon capers, drained and chopped**
- **1 teaspoon harissa** (or to taste)
- **1 teaspoon ground cumin**
- **1 teaspoon ground coriander**
- **Salt and pepper to taste**
- **1/4 cup silken tofu, blended with nutritional yeast and turmeric** (for a "yolky" flavor)

### For Frying:
- **Vegetable oil or olive oil for deep frying**

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Prepare the Filling:**
   - Boil the potatoes in salted water until tender. Drain and mash them with a fork or potato masher. Allow to cool slightly.
   - In a bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, cooked chickpeas or crumbled tofu, olive oil, parsley, capers, harissa, cumin, coriander, and season with salt and pepper. Mix well to combine.

2. **Create the "Yolk":**
   - In a blender, combine the silken tofu, nutritional yeast, turmeric, and a pinch of salt. Blend until smooth, then set aside.

3. **Assemble the Brik:**
   - Lay a sheet of *warqa* or filo dough on a clean, dry surface. If using filo, brush lightly with olive oil.
   - Spoon a portion of the potato-chickpea filling onto one half of the pastry. Make a small indentation in the center of the filling and add a dollop of the blended silken tofu mixture to mimic the egg yolk.

4. **Fold the Pastry:**
   - Fold the pastry over to create a half-moon shape, encasing the filling. Press the edges together to seal tightly; you can use a little water on your fingers to help seal the edges.

5. **Fry the Brik:**
   - Heat vegetable oil in a deep frying pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, carefully add the filled pastries, frying until golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes per side. Do not overcrowd the pan.

6. **Drain and Serve:**
   - Remove the brik from the oil and place on a paper towel to drain excess oil. Serve immediately with lemon wedges on the side.

## Serving Suggestions
Serve the vegan brik hot, with a generous squeeze of fresh lemon juice to brighten the flavors. Pair it with a side salad or a traditional Tunisian condiment like *zhug* or pickled vegetables for a complete meal.

## Cultural Context and Family Notes
Brik holds a special place in the heart of the Silver-Cohen-Trabelsi family, often featured at festive gatherings and during everyday meals. This dish symbolizes unity and connection, as families come together to enjoy and share the vibrant flavors of Tunisian Jewish cuisine.
