# Vegan Vegetable Patties (כפיתות)

## Cultural Background
Vegetable patties, known in Hebrew as "כפיתות" (Kfitot), are a cherished dish with roots in Tunisian Jewish cuisine, particularly from the island of Djerba. This culinary tradition reflects a vibrant blend of North African, Mediterranean, and Jewish influences, utilizing seasonal vegetables to create hearty, flavorful patties that served both as a staple food and a celebratory dish during special occasions.

## Ingredient List
- **Base Ingredients:**
  - 2 medium zucchinis, grated
  - 1 medium carrot, grated
  - 1 medium potato, peeled and grated
  - 1 cup cooked chickpeas, mashed
  - 1 small onion, finely chopped
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
- **Vegan Binders:**
  - 2 tablespoons flaxseed meal + 6 tablespoons water (flax egg)
  - 1/2 cup gluten-free breadcrumbs or matzah meal (for gluten-free)
- **Flavoring:**
  - 1 teaspoon ground cumin
  - 1 teaspoon ground coriander
  - 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
  - 1-2 tablespoons harissa (adjust to taste)
  - 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
  - 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- **For Frying:**
  - Neutral oil (e.g., avocado oil or sunflower oil for frying)
  
**Substitution Notes:**
- For a denser texture, you can substitute the flax egg with a chickpea flour batter (3 tablespoons chickpea flour + 3 tablespoons water).
- Use seasonal vegetables to enhance flavor and nutrition.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Prepare the Flax Egg:** In a small bowl, mix the flaxseed meal with water and let it rest for 10-15 minutes until it thickens.
2. **Sauté Aromatics:** In a pan, heat a tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Sauté the chopped onions and minced garlic until they are soft and translucent.
3. **Combine Vegetables:** In a large mixing bowl, add the grated zucchini, carrot, potato, and mashed chickpeas. Mix in the sautéed onions and garlic.
4. **Add Seasoning:** Sprinkle in the ground cumin, coriander, smoked paprika, harissa, parsley, and cilantro. Mix thoroughly.
5. **Incorporate Binders:** Add the prepared flax egg and breadcrumbs/matzah meal to the vegetable mixture. Stir until everything is well combined. Let the mixture sit for 15-20 minutes to allow the binders to activate.
6. **Shape Patties:** With your hands, form the mixture into small patties, about the size of your palm. Place them on a plate.
7. **Fry the Patties:** In a frying pan, heat enough oil over medium heat to coat the bottom. Fry the patties in batches, about 3-4 minutes per side, until they are golden brown and crispy.
8. **Drain and Serve:** Once cooked, place the patties on a paper towel to drain excess oil. Serve warm.
