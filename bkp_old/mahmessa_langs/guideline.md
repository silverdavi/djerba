A usable design guide needs to lock down hierarchy, repetition, and constraints so every recipe looks consistent. Here is a clear structural blueprint for your 4-language, 4-page, 8×8-inch recipe module.

---

## **1. Global Layout Rules**

* Page size: **8×8 in** square.
* Grid: **4-column baseline grid**, flexible for language blocks; each language gets its own vertical zone.
* Margins: **0.5 in** outer, **0.75 in** inner (for fold spreads).
* Typography:

  * Latin languages: one coordinated serif or sans-serif family.
  * Hebrew and Arabic: their native typefaces, weight harmonized with Latin.
* Color palette: neutral background + one accent color.
* Icons: small glyphs for prep time, cook time, servings, difficulty.

---

## **2. Four-Page Recipe Module Structure**

### **Page 1 — Title + Description + Etymology/History**

Purpose: Introduce the dish before any instructions.

**Structure:**

* Top: dish name in **four languages**, arranged horizontally or stacked, but always in the same order (e.g., Hebrew → Spanish → Arabic → English or another fixed sequence).
* Center block: short paragraph describing the dish (≤120 words), also in the four languages.
  Four parallel blocks, identical structure, aligned in columns.
* Bottom strip: etymology/history note (≤80 words), same four-language layout.
* Visual elements: light background pattern or monotone accent circle for identity; no food photography on this page.

**Design goal:** Clear multilingual identity; the page works as a “cover” for the recipe.

---

### **Page 2 — Image Page (Full Visual)**

Purpose: Draw the reader in; one strong image only.

**Structure:**

* Full-bleed or near-full-bleed hero image of the completed dish or a key preparation moment.
* Optional caption strip at bottom: dish name in four languages in microtype.
* No text blocks, no metadata.

**Design goal:** Visual breathing room between text-dense pages.

---

### **Page 3 — Ingredients + Metadata (All Languages, Side-by-Side)**

Purpose: Present all technical data neutrally.

**Structure:**

* Top: metadata row with icons (servings, prep time, cook time, difficulty).
  Text repeated in four languages under the icons or aligned in columns.
* Middle: ingredients list in four columns, one column per language.
  Keep ordering identical across languages.
* Formatting:

  * Bold ingredient names; plain amounts.
  * Never reorder items by language.

**Design goal:** Immediate scanning and multilingual consistency.

---

### **Page 4 — Instructions (All Languages, Side-by-Side)**

Purpose: Procedure page.

**Structure:**

* Four columns — Hebrew, Spanish, Arabic, English (or a different fixed order).
  All columns share the same step numbering.
* Each step is a short block (3–4 lines), broken logically at the same places across languages.
* Optional: sub-modes such as *dry version* / *saucy version* implemented as two numbered subsections.
* Bottom: small cross-language note or tips section (same structure as top).

**Design goal:** Clear parallelism across languages; easy to locate corresponding steps.

## **3. Language Ordering Convention**

Pick one canonical order and never change it.
Common choice in multilingual Middle Eastern cookbooks:
**Hebrew → Spanish → Arabic → English.**

Rationale: visually distinct scripts help readers anchor quickly.

---

## **4. Visual Identity Across All Recipes**

To maintain uniformity:

* All recipes follow the exact 4-page template.
* Title page always text-heavy; image page always standalone; last two pages always quad-column text.
* Page numbers and running headers optional, but if used, must repeat the four-language name of the dish or its icon.
* Each recipe may use one accent color (fixed palette per section or per cuisine).

---

## **5. Production Rules**

* Translation lengths vary; lock column widths and allow vertical overflow only within the page.
  If one language runs long, abbreviate rather than let it spill.
* Maintain a single master InDesign template with four linked text frames per page.
* Keep ingredient and instruction lists strict in ordering; do not let translators reorder or rewrite structure.
