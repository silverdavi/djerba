# YOYO - HISTORY

**Hebrew Name:** יויו

---

Yoyo (יויו) is a sweet, fried pastry closely tied to the Tunisian-Jewish community, particularly those from Djerba. It holds a special place in Jewish-Tunisian festive and holiday culture and features notable regional preparation details.

### Historical Origins

Yoyo is believed to have originated in southern Tunisia, with especially deep roots in the Jewish communities of Djerba and Tunis[14][6]. Evidence suggests that the dish was created to break the fast during Ramadan and then woven into broader Jewish culinary traditions, becoming a signature celebration treat among both Jewish and Muslim Tunisians[14]. Tunisian Jews, a community with millennia-old history dating back to antiquity, adapted this regional pastry to fit Jewish dietary laws and occasions[6]. Many carried the recipe with them to Israel and France after leaving Tunisia during the 20th century[6][2].

### Cultural Significance

Yoyo is strongly associated with celebration and togetherness within the community. For Jews of Tunisian origin, yoyo is a Hanukkah tradition due to its fried nature (oil-rich foods are symbolic of the Hanukkah miracle)[2]. It’s also served at other festive moments, such as breaking the Yom Kippur fast, during special family occasions, and sometimes at weddings or communal gatherings[14][2]. In Tunisia, it is still enjoyed during the holy month of Ramadan by Muslims, reflecting a shared local heritage[14][18].

### Etymology

The name "yoyo" (יויו) appears directly derived from the French transliteration of the dish's fun, round, playful shape—some say it refers to the resemblance to the toy of the same name, but in this context, it is more likely an affectionate local term without an ancient or symbolic origin[2][15]. There is no direct evidence that the name has deeper linguistic roots in Hebrew or Arabic.

### Regional Variations

- **Tunisia (Jewish and Muslim communities):** The standard yoyo is a round, deep-fried doughnut flavored with orange zest, sometimes anise, and typically glazed with a citrus syrup made from orange blossom water and honey or sugar[14][2][18]. They may be garnished with coconut, sesame seeds, or chopped pistachios depending on family custom[14].
- **Djerba:** Yoyos from Djerba emphasize orange and sometimes include additional spice such as cardamom. There is often a special texture achieved by careful dough preparation specific to Djerban Jewish bakers[2].
- **France/Israel (diaspora communities):** Migrants sometimes adapt ingredients to what's locally available, but the traditional orange-blossom syrup and method are carefully preserved. Some bakers introduce a floral note with rose water or alter toppings for celebrations[2][14].
- **North African context:** The ingredients and preparation sometimes overlap with broader Maghrebi doughnut traditions such as sfenj, but yoyo is distinctly connected to the Tunisian Jewish experience, with its special glaze and festival tie-ins[11][18].
