*   **Meaning:** The root **ب-س-س (b-s-s)** in Arabic generally means "to mix," "to moisten," or "to crumble." Therefore, "bsisa" refers to a preparation made by mixing ingredients, often grains, with oil or water. It describes the process of mixing dry ingredients with a liquid to create a paste or porridge.
