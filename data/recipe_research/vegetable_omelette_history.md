# VEGETABLE OMELETTE - HISTORY

**Hebrew Name:** נעז'ה \- חביתת ירק

---

The "Vegetable Omelette" (נעז'ה - חביתת ירק), also known as "Neja," is a deeply rooted dish in Tunisian and particularly Djerban Jewish culinary traditions. Here are concise, research-backed findings on its origins, meaning, and cultural context.

### Historical Origins

Neja (נעז'ה) originated among the Jewish communities of Tunisia, especially on the island of Djerba, where a distinct Jewish culture has thrived for centuries. Its roots are tied to the Mediterranean omelette tradition, but it has developed a unique character and prominence in Djerban Jewish cuisine, particularly from the 19th century onward. The use of locally available greens and herbs reflects both resourcefulness and adaptation to North African agricultural environments.

### Cultural Significance

Neja holds a special place in Jewish Tunisian homes, symbolizing both everyday sustenance and holiday celebration. It is commonly served during Passover, when leavened foods are avoided, as well as on Sabbath evenings and festivals. The dish is associated with hospitality and communal gatherings, making it integral to family and religious life.

### Etymology

The name "נעז'ה" ("Neja," also transliterated "Naja" or "Nejja") refers to a fluffy, vegetable-laden omelette. The Hebrew term "חביתת ירק" translates literally as "herb omelette" or "vegetable omelette". The word "נעז'ה" is thought to derive from Judeo-Arabic, reflecting the blend of languages in Tunisian Jewish communities.

### Regional Variations

The base of Neja is eggs and fresh greens (such as parsley, cilantro, or spinach), but recipes vary across regions and families:

- **Djerba**: Often includes fenugreek leaves (hilba), leek, green onions, potatoes, and sometimes chard. Some versions add matzo meal during Passover.
- **Urban Tunis**: May lean more on potato and parsley, with less emphasis on fenugreek. Spices such as cumin or turmeric can be added for flavor.
- **Other North African Jewish Communities**: Occasionally incorporate meat or cheese, though the vegetarian version is traditional for religious observance.

The specific choice of herbs and preparation techniques reflects what is locally available and the family's traditions, giving rise to multiple interpretations of this classic dish.
