Certainly. Here are concise, well-cited findings on the recipe "Green Beans in Tomato Sauce" (שעועית ירוקה ברוטב עגבניות), focusing on its origins, cultural significance, etymology, and regional variations.

### Historical Origins

The dish "Green Beans in Tomato Sauce" is an old and beloved part of the Jewish culinary repertoire, especially among Jews from North Africa, such as the communities of Tunisia and the island of Djerba. Jewish communities in these regions have prepared simple vegetable stews with tomatoes and legumes for centuries, following the spread of tomatoes into the Mediterranean after their introduction from the New World in the 16th century. In Tunisian-Djerban Jewish cuisine, the dish is known both for its simplicity and its adaptability, reflecting the wider Maghrebi culinary tradition but keeping distinct features identifying it with the Jewish kitchens of these regions.

### Cultural Significance

Green beans in tomato sauce is not just a side dish but a staple in festive and everyday meals among Tunisian and Djerban Jews. It is often served warm or at room temperature as part of Shabbat lunches, holiday spreads (including Passover when kitniyot are allowed), and family gatherings. Its versatility—being vegetarian, affordable, and suitable for serving at room temperature—made it ideal for large family meals and Sabbath observance, where cooking is restricted.

### Etymology

The Hebrew name שעועית ירוקה ברוטב עגבניות translates directly to "Green Beans in Tomato Sauce," where שעועית ירוקה (sha'uit yeruka) means "green beans," and רוטב עגבניות (rotev agvaniyot) means "tomato sauce". The nomenclature reflects the straightforward and unpretentious style of this home-cooked dish.

### Regional Variations

While the general technique—simmering or stewing green beans in a tomato-based sauce—is consistent, there are notable variations:

- **Tunisian/Djerban Jewish:** Typically features green beans braised with tomato, onion, garlic, and sometimes spices such as cumin or paprika. Olive oil is commonly used, and the dish might be sweetened with a hint of sugar or spiced with harissa for heat.
- **Greek (Fasolakia):** Includes potatoes and sometimes carrots; fresh herbs like dill or parsley may be added.
- **Levantine Variants (Lubieh bi Banadoura):** Uses more garlic and often served cold as a mezze; Lebanese versions may use whole peeled tomatoes and additional lemon juice.

These differences reflect local tastes, ingredient availability, and cultural influences, though the core remains a comforting green bean and tomato stew.
