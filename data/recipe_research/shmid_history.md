# SHMID - HISTORY

**Hebrew Name:** שמיד

---

After extensive research, there is no clear evidence of a dish called "Shmid" (שמיד) in Tunisian, Djerban, or broader Jewish culinary traditions. The term does not appear in authoritative sources on Tunisian-Jewish cuisine, nor is it referenced in major culinary databases or Jewish food archives[21][23][30]. 

### Historical Origins
No documented dish named "Shmid" exists in the culinary history of Tunisian or Djerban Jews. The closest related dishes are "Pkaila" (also spelled "Pkaïla"), a slow-cooked stew of spinach or Swiss chard, beans, and meat, which is emblematic of Tunisian Jewish cuisine and especially associated with Djerba[21][23]. Pkaila is considered a signature dish of the community, but there is no mention of "Shmid" as a distinct recipe or variant.

### Cultural Significance
Pkaila is traditionally served on Shabbat and holidays, often as a centerpiece dish, and is valued for its deep flavors and long cooking process, which aligns with Jewish Sabbath traditions[23]. If "Shmid" were a regional or family variation, it would likely be a lesser-known or localized name for a dish similar to Pkaila, but no such usage is documented in culinary or cultural sources.

### Etymology
The Hebrew word "Shemida" (שְׁמִידָע) is a biblical name meaning "renowned" or "knowledge of the name," but it is not connected to any known food dish[3]. The name "Shmid" does not appear in culinary etymologies or food-related lexicons.

### Regional Variations
The main regional variation in Tunisian Jewish cuisine is between Pkaila (spinach or chard stew) and Madfoun (a similar dish with ground beef and Swiss chard, more common in Tunis)[21]. There are no documented regional variations of a dish called "Shmid."

In summary, "Shmid" does not appear to be a recognized dish in Tunisian or Djerban Jewish cuisine. The closest relevant dish is Pkaila, which is central to the culinary traditions of the community[21][23][30].
