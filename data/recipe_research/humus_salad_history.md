Okay, based on the provided search results, here's what I can tell you about "humus salad," keeping in mind the limitations of the information available:

**1. ETYMOLOGY**

*   **Arabic Root:** The word "hummus" (حُمُّص) itself comes from the Arabic word for "chickpeas." The root is ح-م-ص.
*   **Literal Meaning:** "Hummus" literally means "chickpeas" in Arabic.
*   **Alternate Spellings/Names:** The word is generally transliterated as "hummus" in English. Variations in spelling exist (e.g., houmous), but these are primarily stylistic.
*   **Humus Salad:** The search results indicate that "humus salad" as a specific, traditionally named dish in North African Jewish cuisine is **not documented**. It's more likely a modern adaptation or description of hummus served with additional ingredients.

**2. HISTORICAL ORIGINS**

*   **Origin:** The search results suggest that "humus salad" as a distinct dish with a documented history **does not exist** within North African Jewish culinary traditions. While hummus itself is a common ingredient, the concept of a "humus salad" is likely a more recent development.
*   **Associated Communities:** Because it's not a historically documented dish, it's not specifically associated with any particular Jewish community in North Africa (Djerba, Tangier, etc.).
*   **Age of Tradition:** Since it's likely a modern adaptation, there's no established tradition associated with "humus salad" in North African Jewish cuisine.

**3. CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE**

*   Because "humus salad" is not a traditional dish, there are no established cultural significances, serving times, rituals, or symbolic meanings associated with it in the context of North African Jewish cuisine.

**4. REGIONAL VARIATIONS**

*   Since it's not a traditional dish, there are no established regional variations within North African Jewish cuisine.
*   **Israeli Adaptations:** The search results suggest that "humus salad" is more likely a modern Israeli or Mediterranean dish, where hummus is mixed with vegetables and spices.
*   **Family Variations:** Modern family variations likely exist, but these are not rooted in historical tradition.

**5. TRADITIONAL INGREDIENTS**

*   Since "humus salad" is not a traditional dish, there are no fixed "authentic" ingredients.
*   Based on the recipe provided (chickpeas, pickled lemon, paprika, salt, cilantro), it seems to be a modern adaptation using hummus as a base.

**Important Notes:**

*   The search results emphasize that while hummus itself is a part of North African Jewish cuisine, "humus salad" as a specific, named dish is not documented in historical sources or on Wikipedia.
*   The provided recipe appears to be a modern interpretation.

**Conclusion:**

While hummus is a common ingredient in North African Jewish cuisine, "humus salad" as a distinct, traditionally named dish does not appear to exist within that culinary tradition. It's more likely a modern adaptation or description of hummus served with additional ingredients.
