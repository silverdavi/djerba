# BRIK - HISTORY

**Hebrew Name:** בריקות

---

### Historical Origins

Brik is a deep-fried savory pastry originally from Tunisia, widely considered a cornerstone of North African cuisine, particularly among Tunisian-Djerban Jews[6][9][16]. Historical theories suggest that Brik’s roots stretch back at least 500 years, possibly developing in southern Tunisia amid the Jewish community before becoming a wider regional phenomenon[1][9][13]. There are also connections to Ottoman Turkish börek, both linguistically and in technique, although Brik’s specific method and fillings mark it as distinctively Tunisian-Jewish in origin[1][6][5].

### Cultural Significance

Brik holds a special place as a food of both everyday enjoyment and ritual importance[2][6][10]. It is most famously served at the start of iftar, the meal that breaks the fast during Ramadan, and is also prominent at family gatherings, Shabbat meals, and celebrations within the Jewish community of Djerba and beyond[2][10][16]. Its communal preparation and consumption underscore themes of hospitality, family, and continuity within Tunisian culture[6][2][16].

### Etymology

The name "Brik" is thought to derive from the Turkish "börek," referring to a similar savory pastry[1][5][9]. The root "bur" in Turkish means "to twist," which also speaks to the folding of the dough around the filling[9]. In Tunisia, the pastry sheet used for Brik is called "malsouka" or "warqa," the latter being an Arabic word meaning "paper," reflecting the pastry's thinness[9].

### Regional Variations

Brik recipes vary across Tunisia and North Africa, primarily in the choice of fillings and pastry shape[17][20]. In southern Tunisia, harissa (spicy chili paste) and potato are common fillings, especially in Djerba, while in the north, tuna and egg are preferred[5][9][17]. Other regional fillings include minced lamb, seafood, capers, and aromatic spices, wrapped in malsouka and usually deep-fried to a crisp[2][12][20]. Outside Tunisia, variations exist under different names (e.g., "bourek" in Algeria), each with indigenous adaptations to local ingredients and customs[5][17][20].
