# BIKILA - HISTORY

**Hebrew Name:** בקילה

---

Here are concise findings on the dish "Bikila" (בקילה), focused on its historical origins, cultural role, etymology, and regional variations, with emphasis on Tunisian-Djerban Jewish traditions.

### Historical Origins
The dish commonly associated with the name "Bikila" in the context of Tunisian and Djerban Jewish cuisine is more widely spelled and known as pkaila, pkaïla, or bkeila (בקילה in Hebrew letters, pronounced bikila or bkeila). It is a deep-green stew traditionally made by cooking down large amounts of spinach or other greens with beans (often white beans) and sometimes meat (like beef)[14][10]. This dish originated among the Jews of Tunisia and especially Djerba, who have maintained distinct culinary traditions for centuries. Some sources indicate the community has been present since Roman times, and the dish is characterized as distinctly Jewish in wider Tunisia but embraced by all communities on Djerba[2][6].

### Cultural Significance
Bikila/pkaila holds significant cultural importance for Tunisian and Djerban Jews. It is considered the ultimate comfort food and is traditionally served during Shabbat, Rosh Hashanah, and other Jewish festivals[10]. The practice of slow-cooking it overnight or for many hours is linked to Jewish ritual observance prohibiting cooking on holidays or the Sabbath. Thus, the dish is both practical and symbolic: it allows families to enjoy a rich, flavorful meal in accordance with religious tradition[10]. In Djerba, it crossed over, becoming part of the island’s universal cuisine, shared by Jewish and non-Jewish neighbors alike[2][6].

### Etymology
The origins of the name "bikila" (בקילה) or its variants "pkaïla, pkaila, bkeila" are not definitively established in standard etymological references. However, the name is likely derived from terms relating to "greens" or "spinach" in North African Judeo-Arabic dialects[14]. The word does not appear to have any relation to the Amharic (Ethiopian) name "Bikila," which means something entirely different[11][7]. In the culinary context, it specifically names the Jewish Tunisian stew of greens and beans.

### Regional Variations
The dish's preparation can vary by region and family tradition:
- In most of Tunisia, pkaila is known as a Jewish dish, while on Djerba, it is widespread among all communities[2][6].
- The core components are spinach (or chard), beans, and sometimes beef. Preparation involves frying greens until nearly black, then simmering with beans and meat for hours, often overnight[14].
- The use of particular spices, types of meat, and the balance of spinach or chard can differ by household.
- Some substitute ingredients due to availability, but the long simmering technique remains constant.
