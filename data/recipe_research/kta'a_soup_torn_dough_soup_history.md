**Hebrew Name:** מרק קטעה

---

Kta'a Soup (מרק קטעה), also known as Torn Dough Soup, is a traditional dish with deep connections to Tunisian-Djerban Jewish heritage. Below is a focused synthesis of its historical origins, cultural significance, etymology, and regional variations, with appropriate citations.

### Historical Origins

Kta'a Soup originated among the Jewish communities of Tunisia, specifically on the island of Djerba, where a vibrant Jewish community has existed for over two millennia. The dish emerged as a staple due to its humble ingredients, which were accessible to families of modest means. The use of torn pieces of dough highlights resourcefulness and the adaptation of local culinary techniques to fit Jewish dietary laws.

### Cultural Significance

Kta'a Soup holds immense importance within Tunisian-Djerban Jewish culture, symbolizing warmth, hospitality, and communal gathering. It is traditionally served on Friday nights for Shabbat dinner and sometimes during cold seasons, as the hearty, comforting broth brings families together. The ritual of tearing dough by hand and preparing the soup collectively reinforces familial bonds and the transmission of cultural traditions across generations.

### Etymology

The name "Kta'a" (קטעה) derives from the Arabic root "kat'a," meaning "to cut" or "to tear," directly referencing the torn pieces of dough that are a defining feature of the soup. In Judeo-Arabic, the word has the same meaning, underscoring the dish's emphasis on this unique preparation method.

### Regional Variations

- **Djerba:** The classic version uses hand-torn wheat dough, simmered in a tomato-rich broth with chickpeas, potatoes, and aromatic spices like caraway and cumin.
- **Mainland Tunisia:** Versions may include the addition of meat (usually lamb or beef), or more varied local vegetables, reflecting available ingredients.
- **Diaspora Adaptations:** Tunisian Jews living in Israel and France sometimes substitute ingredients or adapt the soup for kosher needs, but the torn dough remains the defining element.
