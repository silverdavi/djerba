  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "This is an eponymous name, derived directly from the recipe contributor, Shlomit Perl. Unlike traditional Djerban dishes which are named after ingredients (e.g., 'B'hilat') or cooking methods (e.g., 'Mhamsa'), this title reflects the modern practice in community cookbooks of attributing specific non-traditional or fusion recipes to their source. The ingredients (soy sauce, mayonnaise, mustard) indicate this is a modern addition to the culinary repertoire, likely influenced by the 'Chinese Cabbage Salad' (Salat Kruv Sini) trend popular in Israel and the Jewish diaspora from the 1980s onwards, rather than a heritage Maghrebi dish.",

    "confidence": "confirmed",
    "sources_notes": "The presence of soy sauce confirms this is not a traditional North African Jewish dish. The name is explicitly stated as the contributor's name in the provided text."
