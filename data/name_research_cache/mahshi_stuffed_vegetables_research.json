    "etymology": "Derived directly from the Arabic root 'ḥ-š-y' (ح-ش-y), meaning 'to stuff' or 'to fill'. 'Mahshi' (محشي) is the passive participle (ism maf'ul) of the verb, literally translating to 'that which is stuffed'. While the concept of stuffed vegetables in North Africa was heavily influenced by the Ottoman Turkish 'Dolma', the terminology in the Maghreb is almost exclusively Arabic. In the context of Djerban cuisine, this follows the standard Tunisian naming convention for stuffed vegetables.",

The specific Djerban Jewish variation often uses chicken and egg as a binder (unlike the Levantine use of just rice and ground red meat) to ensure the filling stays intact during the slow stewing process common in Shabbat cooking."
