    "etymology": "The name 'Crumble Tapuchim' (קראמבל תפוחים) is a Modern Hebrew construction. 'Crumble' is a direct transliteration of the English culinary term, which originated in Britain during World War II as a rationing-friendly alternative to pies. 'Tapuchim' is the Hebrew plural for apples (from the root n-p-ch, meaning to blow or swell). This dish is not indigenous to North African Jewish cuisine. Its presence in a Djerban cookbook indicates modern culinary assimilation, likely introduced via the French Jewish diaspora (where 'Le Crumble' became extremely popular in the 1980s) or through modern Israeli culture.",

    "root_word": "English 'Crumble' (from Old English 'crymel') + Hebrew 'Tapuach'",

    "confidence": "confirmed",
    "sources_notes": "This is distinctly a Western dish. Traditional Tunisian desserts rely on nuts, honey, semolina, and frying (like debla or makroud), not baked fruit with streusel. The use of margarine to make it Pareve is a standard Jewish dietary adaptation of the butter-heavy British original."
