    "etymology": "Derived from the Arabic trilateral root ḥ-m-ṣ (ح-م-ص), specifically the verb 'ḥammaṣa' (حمّص), meaning 'to roast', 'to toast', or 'to sear'. The name 'Mhamsa' (محمصة) literally translates to 'that which is toasted/roasted'. Historically, these hand-rolled semolina pearls were dried in the sun or lightly toasted in an oven or pan to preserve them and prevent them from turning into mush when cooked in liquid. This toasting process gives the pasta a nutty flavor distinct from standard couscous.",
