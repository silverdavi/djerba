  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "The term 'Brikot' is the Hebraized plural form of the Tunisian Arabic word 'Brik' (بريك). The root of the word is definitively traced to the Ottoman Turkish 'Börek', a general term for filled pastries. The Ottoman Empire controlled Tunisia from the 16th to the 19th century, introducing the concept of phyllo/yufka doughs. In Tunisia, this evolved into the 'Malsouka' (the specific leaf) and the dish became 'Brik'. The suffix '-ot' (ות) is the Hebrew feminine plural marker, indicating that 'Brikot' is the specific terminology used by Tunisian Jews (and subsequently in Israel) to refer to multiple pieces of the pastry.",
    "language_source": "turkish",
    "root_word": "Börek (Turkish) -> Brik (Tunisian Arabic)",
    "meaning": "Originally referring to any dish made with yufka (dough sheets); in Tunisia specifically denotes the deep-fried Malsouka packet.",
    "confidence": "confirmed",
    "sources_notes": "Standard culinary etymology (Gil Marks, Claudia Roden). The phonetic shift from 'Börek' to 'Brik' is a standard contraction in Maghrebi dialects. The form 'Brikot' represents the linguistic integration of the dish into Judeo-Arabic and Modern Hebrew syntax."
