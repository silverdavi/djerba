    "etymology": "The name 'Marmouma' (or Marmouma) is specific to Tunisian Arabic (Derja). It likely derives from the Arabic root 'r-m-m' (رمم) or 'r-m' which can imply repairing or, in a dialectal sense, something that has been broken down or reduced. In the culinary context, it refers to the vegetables being cooked down until they lose their individual structure and become a cohesive, jam-like spread. It is linguistically distinct from the Moroccan 'Matbucha' (which simply means 'cooked'), though the dish is nearly identical. Some linguistic theories suggest a corruption of 'Maghmouma' (مغمومة), meaning 'smothered' or 'covered', referring to the cooking method of simmering in a covered pot to reduce the liquid, but 'Marmouma' is the established term in Tunisia.",

    "sources_notes": "While 'Matbucha' is the pan-Maghrebi Jewish term often used in Israel, 'Marmouma' is the specific shibboleth of Tunisian and Djerban Jews. The distinction is crucial in Tunisia: 'Slata Mechouia' is grilled and ground, whereas 'Marmouma' is stewed/reduced in a pot."
