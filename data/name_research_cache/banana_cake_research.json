    "etymology": "The name 'Ugat Bananot' is Modern Hebrew. 'Uga' (עוגה) comes from the Biblical Hebrew root 'ug' (עוג) meaning 'to be round' or 'circle', originally referring to round baked breads. 'Bananot' is the plural of 'Banana', an international loan word ultimately derived from Wolof (West Africa) via Spanish/Portuguese. This is not a traditional, ancient Judeo-Arabic dish (as bananas were not a staple baking ingredient in pre-modern North Africa), but rather a 20th-century addition to the repertoire, likely introduced during the French Protectorate era (influenced by the French 'Gâteau aux bananes') or later in Israel. The use of sour milk suggests an adaptation using local 'Lben' (fermented milk) to mimic buttermilk or yogurt in Western-style baking.",
