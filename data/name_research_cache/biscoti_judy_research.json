  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "The name is a modern hybrid. 'Biscotti' is the plural of the Italian 'biscotto', derived from the Latin 'bis' (twice) and 'coctus' (cooked/baked). However, in the context of Tunisian cuisine (influenced by the Livornese 'Grana' Jews and French colonialism), the term 'biscuit' or 'biscotto' was Arabized into 'Bachkoutou' (bash-koo-too), referring generically to cookies. The specific name 'Judy' refers to the family member who created this variation. The description indicates this is not a true twice-baked biscotti, but rather a 'Mandelbrot' style loaf-cookie adapted with oil (parve) and chocolate chips, reflecting a fusion of North African pareve baking traditions with modern Western ingredients.",
    "language_source": "other",
    "root_word": "Latin 'bis' + 'coctus' (via Italian/French)",
    "meaning": "Judy's Twice-Baked Cookies (though technically a misnomer in this recipe context)",
    "confidence": "confirmed",
    "sources_notes": "The etymology of 'biscotti' is standard Latin/Italian. The usage here is colloquial. In Tunisia, 'Bachkoutou' is the standard loanword for biscuits. The use of oil instead of butter is a hallmark of Judeo-Arabic parve baking to accommodate Kosher dietary laws (Kashrut) regarding meat meals."
