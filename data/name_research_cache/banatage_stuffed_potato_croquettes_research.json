  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "The name 'Banatage' (or Banatache) is likely a linguistic corruption of the Spanish/Ladino word 'Empanada' (or the archaic 'Panada'), filtered through Tunisian Arabic phonology. In Arabic, the letter 'P' does not exist and is often replaced by 'B' (e.g., 'Pepsi' becomes 'Bebsi'). Therefore, 'Empanada' became 'Mbanada' or 'Banada'. The suffix '-age' or '-ej' likely reflects a Maghrebi pluralization or a French colonial phonetic influence on the ending. Historically, 'Banadhej' appears in medieval Andalusian-Maghrebi cookbooks referring to small stuffed pies. The Djerban Jewish innovation was substituting the wheat dough with a potato-based dough (likely for Passover/Pesach compliance), while retaining the name for 'stuffed vessel'.",
    "language_source": "ladino",
    "root_word": "Empanada / Panada",
    "meaning": "Literally 'breaded' or 'enbreaded' (originally referring to dough-wrapped items)",
    "confidence": "likely",
    "sources_notes": "Linguistic shift P -> B is standard in Judeo-Arabic. The dish is culinarily identical to 'Papas Rellenas' but carries a name derived from dough-based pastries, supporting the theory that it is a Passover adaptation of a flour-based pastel."
