    "etymology": "The Hebrew name 'Hatifey Shokolad ve-Hemat Botnim' is a direct, descriptive translation into Modern Hebrew of the American concept. The term 'Hatif' (חטיף) is Modern Hebrew for 'snack' or 'treat' (derived from the root ח-ט-ף meaning to snatch or grab quickly). 'Hemat Botnim' (חמאת בוטנים) is the Modern Hebrew calque for 'Peanut Butter'. The English name 'Buddy Bars' likely references a popular American commercial snack (Little Debbie's Peanut Butter Crunch Bars, historically marketed as 'Buddy Bars') or a specific recipe from the 'Betty Crocker' era of American baking. This is not a traditional North African dish but represents the culinary assimilation of the Jewish diaspora.",
