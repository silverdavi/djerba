    "etymology": "The word 'Schnitzel' is of German origin, derived from the verb 'schnitzen', meaning 'to carve' or 'to cut'. The suffix '-el' is a diminutive, so the word literally translates to 'a little cut' or 'a slice'. While the dish originated in Austria (Wiener Schnitzel, made with veal), it was brought to Israel by Central European (Ashkenazi) immigrants. In Israel, due to the scarcity of veal, turkey and chicken became the standard proteins. It was subsequently adopted by North African Jewish communities (including Djerbans) in Israel and France, often replacing more complex traditional fried dishes due to its convenience and popularity with children.",
