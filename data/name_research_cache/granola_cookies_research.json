    "etymology": "The name is a modern Hebrew construction consisting of two parts. 'Ugiot' (עוגיות) is the plural of 'Ugiah', the Modern Hebrew word for cookie/cake, derived from the Biblical root 'Oog' (ע-ו-ג) meaning 'to draw a circle' or 'round', referring to the shape of traditional baked goods (seen in Biblical Hebrew 'Ugah'). 'Granola' is a direct loanword from English. The term 'Granola' was coined in the United States in the late 19th century by W.K. Kellogg (modified from James Caleb Jackson's 'Granula') based on the Latin root 'granum' (grain). This dish represents the modernization of the North African Jewish kitchen, incorporating Western/Israeli baking trends.",

    "sources_notes": "This is not a traditional Judeo-Arabic or Maghrebi dish.

This recipe reflects the influence of Modern Israeli cuisine or French/American baking trends on the Djerban community in the post-colonial era."
