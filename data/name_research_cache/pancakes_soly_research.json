{
  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "The name is a modern construct found in Israeli/Diaspora Jewish culture rather than a traditional North African dialect. It combines the English loanword 'Pancake' (transliterated phonetically into Hebrew as פנקייק) with the possessive nickname 'Soly'. 'Soly' is a common affectionate diminutive for the name Solomon (Shlomo) among North African (Sephardic/Mizrahi) Jews. The use of the English loanword instead of traditional Tunisian terms like 'Ghraif' or 'Baghrir' indicates this is a Western recipe adopted by the family and adapted to be Kosher Parve, rather than an indigenous Djerban dish.",
    "language_source": "hebrew",
    "root_word": "English 'Pancake' + Name 'Solomon'",
    "meaning": "Pancakes made by or associated with Soly (Solomon)",
    "confidence": "confirmed",
    "sources_notes": "Linguistic analysis of the Hebrew text (פנקייק) confirms it is a modern loanword. Traditional Djerban cuisine would use Judeo-Arabic terms if the dish were pre-colonial/indigenous."
