  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "The term is a direct loanword from the French culinary term 'fricassée', introduced during the French Protectorate of Tunisia (1881–1956). However, this represents a distinct case of semantic shift or 'faux amis' (false friends). In classical French cuisine, a 'fricassée' is a white stew of meat (usually chicken) cooked in sauce. In Tunisian dialect (Derja), the term was appropriated to refer exclusively to these savory fried doughnuts. The linguistic bridge is likely phonetic: the French verb 'frire' (to fry) sounds similar to the prefix 'fric-', leading locals to associate the French word 'fricassée' with the action of deep-frying, or potentially a portmanteau folk-etymology of 'frit' (fried) and 'cassé' (broken/sliced open).",
    "language_source": "french",
    "root_word": "fricassée (French) / fricasser (Old French: to fry/cook)",
    "meaning": "Originally 'a stew of cut-up meat' (French), but evolved to mean 'fried stuffed sandwich' in Tunisian context.",
    "confidence": "confirmed",
    "sources_notes": "The French origin of the word is linguistically certain, but the culinary divergence is absolute. There is no recipe connection between the French stew and the Tunisian sandwich; the connection is purely lexical, born of the colonial interface between French and Tunisian Arabic."
