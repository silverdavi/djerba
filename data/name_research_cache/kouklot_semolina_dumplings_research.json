  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "The term 'Kouklot' (Hebrew plural of 'Koukla') is specific to the Tripolitan (Libyan) and Djerban Jewish communities. The most linguistically probable origin is the Turkish word 'Kukla' (meaning 'doll' or 'puppet'), introduced during the centuries of Ottoman rule in Tripoli and Tunisia. In culinary nomenclature, it is common to name small, hand-shaped dough items after small figures or body parts (similar to 'orecchiette' or 'little ears'). Alternatively, some linguists suggest a connection to the Latin 'Cuculla' (covering/hood) via Italian influence, originally referring to the casing of the stuffed intestine (Osban) from which this dish is derived, though the Turkish phonetic match is exact.",

    "meaning": "Doll or Puppet",
    "confidence": "likely",
    "sources_notes": "The Ottoman Empire ruled the Maghreb (including Tripoli and Tunis) for centuries, leaving several loan words in the local dialects (Derja). The dish is essentially the filling of 'Osban' (stuffed intestine) cooked as a standalone dumpling. The anthropomorphic naming convention ('doll') for dumplings is found in Greek and Turkish food history."
