  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "The name derives from the Maghrebi Arabic root Ṣ-Y-R (ص-ي-ر), specifically the form II verb 'ṣayyar' (صيّر), which means to preserve, cure, or pickle (usually in salt and lemon rather than vinegar). The word 'Msiyar' (or Msayyar) is the passive participle meaning 'preserved' or 'cured.' While in Morocco and Algeria the cognate term 'M'sir' refers almost exclusively to preserved lemons, in Tunisian Jewish usage, it applies to this specific quick-pickled salad of peppers and carrots cured in lemon juice.",
    "language_source": "tunisian_arabic",
    "root_word": "Ṣayyar (صيّر)",
    "meaning": "Preserved / Cured / Pickled",
    "confidence": "likely",
    "sources_notes": "Based on the standard Maghrebi culinary term 'M'sir' (preserved lemons) and the grammatical structure of the passive participle in Tunisian Derja. The Hebrew spelling משייר (Msiyar) preserves the 'y' sound of the form II verb, distinguishing it from the generic Arabic 'Mkhallal' (pickles)."
