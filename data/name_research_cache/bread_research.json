  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "The Hebrew name 'Lechem Bayit' is a direct calque (loan translation) of the Maghrebi Arabic term 'Khobz Dar' (خبز دار) or the French 'Pain de Maison'. In North African culture, a distinct separation exists between 'Khobz Souq' (market bread/baguettes bought daily) and 'Khobz Dar' (bread made by the housewife). While the name provided is Modern Hebrew, the culinary concept is strictly North African: a dense, soft-crumbed loaf baked in a home oven rather than a communal tannur or bought from a bakery.",
    "language_source": "hebrew",
    "root_word": "Hebrew: לחם (Lechem - Bread) + בית (Bayit - House); Arabic parallel: خبز (Khobz) + دار (Dar)",
    "meaning": "Bread of the house (Homemade bread)",
    "confidence": "confirmed",
    "sources_notes": "The term 'Lechem Bayit' is a generic descriptor in Israeli/Hebrew cookbooks, but in a Djerban context, it specifically refers to the tradition of 'Khobz Dar'. Unlike the crusty French baguettes introduced during the protectorate, this bread typically uses oil and sugar to create a softer texture suitable for dipping in Shabbat sauces."
