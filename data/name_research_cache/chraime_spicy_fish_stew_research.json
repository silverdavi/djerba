  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "The name is derived from the Arabic root 'ḥ-r-m' (حرم), meaning 'forbidden', 'sacred', or 'taboo'. The specific form 'Chraime' (or 'Hraime') follows the Arabic diminutive pattern (Fu'ayl), literally translating to 'a little forbidden thing' or 'a little sin'. This is a metaphorical name, likely referring to the intense, 'punishing' heat of the dish or the idea that it is so delicious it is sinful. It is important to correct the common misconception in the provided note: the Arabic word for 'hot/spicy' is 'ḥārr' (حار), not 'ḥarām'. However, the phonetics of 'Chraime' align with the root for 'forbidden' (ḥ-r-m), not 'hot' (ḥ-r-r).",
    "language_source": "tunisian_arabic",
    "root_word": "Ḥarām (حرام) - meaning forbidden/sacred",
    "meaning": "Little forbidden thing (diminutive form)",
    "confidence": "likely",
    "sources_notes": "Linguistic analysis of Libyan/Tunisian Judeo-Arabic morphology. While 'Harr' means hot, the 'm' at the end of 'Chraime' confirms the root is Ḥ-R-M. Food historians like Gil Marks attribute the name to the 'forbidden' intensity of the spice."
