  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "Derived directly from the Arabic triconsonantal root Q-Ṭ-ʿ (ق-ط-ع), which encompasses meanings of 'cutting', 'chopping', 'tearing', or 'severing'. In Tunisian Arabic (Derja), the word 'Qat'a' (قطعة) literally means 'a piece' or 'a slice'. The dish name refers to the method of preparation where the fresh dough is manually torn or pinched into irregular 'pieces' before being dropped into the broth. It is linguistically and culinarily cognate with the broader Maghrebi term 'Mqatfa' (meaning 'the cut things' or 'cut pasta'), but the Djerban Jewish nomenclature preserves the noun form 'Kata'a' (Piece).",

    "root_word": "Q-Ṭ-ʿ (ق ط ع)",
    "meaning": "Piece, cutting, or torn fragment",
    "confidence": "likely",
    "sources_notes": "While 'Mqatfa' is the standard term in Algerian and general Tunisian cuisine for fresh artisan pasta soup, the specific Hebrew transliteration 'Kata'a' (קטעה) points to the singular noun 'Qat'a' (piece) used in the Djerban dialect. This naming convention follows the pattern of describing the physical state of the ingredient (the torn piece) rather than the verb (the cutting)."
