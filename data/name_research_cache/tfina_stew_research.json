{
  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "The name derives directly from the Arabic trilateral root D-F-N (د ف ن), meaning 'to bury' or 'to inter'. In the context of North African Jewish cuisine, this refers to the historical cooking method where the pot was hermetically sealed and 'buried' in the embers of the communal oven (ferran) or a charcoal pit on Friday afternoon to cook slowly overnight for Shabbat lunch. In Tunisian and Djerban Judeo-Arabic dialects, the initial 'D' often hardens to a 'T', shifting 'Dafina' to 'Tfina' or 'Tafina'.",

    "root_word": "D-F-N (د ف ن)",
    "meaning": "The buried (pot/dish)",
    "confidence": "confirmed",
    "sources_notes": "This etymology is universally accepted in Judeo-Arabic linguistics and culinary history. It parallels the Spanish/Ladino 'Adafina'. The pronunciation 'Tfina' is specific to the Tunisian/Libyan region, whereas 'Dafina' is more common in Morocco."
