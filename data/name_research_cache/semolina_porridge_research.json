    "etymology": "The name provided ('Daysat Solet') is a Modern Hebrew descriptive term composed of ancient roots, used to translate the traditional North African dish name. 'Daysa' (דַּיְסָה) originates from Mishnaic Hebrew and Jewish Babylonian Aramaic ('daisa'), referring to a dish made of pounded or crushed grain. 'Solet' (סֹלֶת) is Biblical Hebrew for the finest wheaten flour or semolina. However, in the Djerban and Tunisian Judeo-Arabic context, this dish is traditionally known as 'Assida' (عصيدة) or 'Assida bil-hlib' (Porridge with milk).",
    "language_source": "hebrew",
    "root_word": "Hebrew/Aramaic: D-Y-S (to tread/thresh) | Arabic equivalent: 'A-S-D (to twist/stir)",
    "meaning": "Porridge of Semolina (Hebrew) | To thicken/stir vigorously (Arabic original)",
    "confidence": "confirmed",
    "sources_notes": "While the cookbook uses the Hebrew name, Djerban Jews historically used the Tunisian Arabic term 'Assida' or the French 'Bouillie'. The Hebrew 'Daysa' is cognate with Arabic 'Dasha' (to crush). The Arabic root for Assida refers to the vigorous stirring required to prevent lumps."
