    "etymology": "The name provided is Modern Hebrew. 'Lechem' (לחם) means bread. 'Machmetzet' (מחמצת) refers to a sourdough starter or leaven. The root is H-M-Tz (ח-מ-צ), which relates to 'chametz' (leavened food forbidden on Passover) and 'chumtzah' (acid/sourness). Historically, in Djerba and Tunisia, bread was naturally leavened using a piece of old dough called 'khmira' (Arabic) or 'levain' (French), rather than the modern liquid starter implied by the Hebrew word 'machmetzet'. This specific title likely reflects a modern Israeli-Hebrew naming convention for a traditional family recipe.",
