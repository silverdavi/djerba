    "etymology": "The name is descriptive Modern Hebrew. 'Kadurei' (כדורי) is the construct state (smichut) of 'Kadurim' (balls), derived from the root K-D-R denoting roundness. 'Shokolad' is a Modern Hebrew loanword adopted from European languages (German 'Schokolade', Yiddish/Russian 'shokolad'), ultimately derived from the Nahuatl 'xocolātl'. This dish is not traditional to North African Jewish cuisine but is a ubiquitous staple of the modern Israeli kitchen (the 'Kibbutz childhood' dessert) that has been adopted by all Jewish communities in Israel, including Djerbans, often replacing traditional labor-intensive sweets.",
