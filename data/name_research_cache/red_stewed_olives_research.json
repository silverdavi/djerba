    "etymology": "The Hebrew name provided ('Zeitim b'rotev adom') is a modern descriptive translation used in Israel. The authentic Judeo-Arabic name for this Djerban dish is likely 'Zaytun T'bikh' (Stewed Olives) or 'Zaytun Msharmel' (Olives in Chermoula/Sauce). The word 'Zaytun' is the pan-Semitic word for olive. The preparation method—blanching with turmeric before stewing in a tomato reduction—is distinctively Tunisian. In Djerban dialect, dishes are often named simply by their main ingredient followed by the cooking state (e.g., 'T'bikh').",

    "sources_notes": "The Hebrew name provided is purely descriptive. In the context of the Djerban 'Kemia' (appetizer table), this dish is a vegetarian reduction of the famous 'Tajine Zaytun'. The specific technique of using turmeric for blanching is a hallmark of Tunisian Jewish cookery to neutralize bitterness."
