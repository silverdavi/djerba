    "etymology": "The word derives from the Berber (Amazigh) language, specifically the word 'seksu' or 'kesksu'. It entered North African Arabic as 'kuskusi' and later French/English as 'couscous'. While some theories suggest an onomatopoeic origin (the sound of the steam or the sieve), the linguistic consensus points to the Berber root S-K-S, referring to the action of rolling or rounding the wheat granules.",

    "root_word": "Seksu / Kesksu (Berber/Amazigh)",
    "meaning": "Well rolled, rounded, or formed",
    "confidence": "confirmed",
    "sources_notes": "Culinary historians (including Charles Perry and Clifford Wright) confirm the Berber origin, predating the Arab invasion of the Maghreb. The 13th-century Andalusian cookbook 'Fadalat al-Khiwan' confirms its established presence in the region. In Tunisian Judeo-Arabic, it is pronounced 'Kuskusi'."
