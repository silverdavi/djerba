    "etymology": "The name provided is a compound phrase. 'Hita' (חיטה) is the standard Hebrew word for 'wheat'. 'Adafina' is the classic Judeo-Spanish (Ladino) name for the Shabbat stew, which itself derives from the Arabic root 'd-f-n' (دفن), meaning 'to bury', 'to cover', or 'to hide'. This refers to the ancient method of burying the cooking pot in hot embers or sand to maintain heat over the Sabbath without an active flame. The phrase 'Hita l'Adafina' literally translates from Hebrew as 'Wheat for the Adafina'. In the context of Djerban and North African cuisine, this refers to the wheat berries (often hulled) cooked in a muslin bag or separate container within the larger stew to absorb flavors while maintaining a distinct texture.",
    "language_source": "hebrew",
    "root_word": "Arabic: dafana (دفن) / Hebrew: hita (חיטה)",
    "meaning": "Wheat for the buried [stew]",
    "confidence": "confirmed",
    "sources_notes": "While 'Adafina' is the Ladino name, it was widely used in North Africa (often contracted to 'Tfina' in Tunisia/Morocco). The specific construction 'Hita l'Adafina' is likely a descriptive Hebrew name used in the cookbook or by the community in Israel, rather than the vernacular Judeo-Arabic term used in Djerba (which would likely be 'Gara' or 'Haris')."
