    "etymology": "The name 'Marmouma' (مرمومة) is specific to the Tunisian (specifically Southern/Djerban) and Libyan Arabic dialects. It is distinct from the more generic 'Matbucha' (which simply means 'cooked' in Arabic). The etymology likely stems from a dialectal variation of roots describing the texture of the dish—vegetables that are broken down, mashed, or stewed until soft. In the context of Djerban and Libyan cuisine, it refers specifically to a cooked salad where the ingredients are stewed in a pot rather than grilled first (which would be 'Mechouia').",
    "language_source": "tunisian_arabic",
    "root_word": "Unknown (Likely dialectal variation of R-M-M or similar roots denoting softness/disintegration)",
    "meaning": "A stewed or mashed mixture; specifically a cooked tomato and pepper salad",
    "confidence": "likely",
    "sources_notes": "While 'Matbucha' is the pan-Maghrebi term often used in Israel, 'Marmouma' is the specific vernacular used in Djerba and Libya. It is a staple of Libyan Jewish cuisine as well. The term is linguistically distinct from 'Mechouia' (grilled) and 'Makbouba' (another variant)."
