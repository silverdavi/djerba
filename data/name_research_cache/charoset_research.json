    "etymology": "The name is derived from the Mishnaic Hebrew word 'cheres' (חרס), which translates to 'clay', 'earthenware', or 'shard'. This etymology is explicitly cited in the Babylonian Talmud (Pesachim 116a), where the dish is described as symbolizing the clay or mortar used by the Israelites to make bricks during their enslavement in Egypt. The texture and color of the paste are intended to visually mimic this mortar.",
