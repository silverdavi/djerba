    "etymology": "The name 'Pancake' (פנקייק) is a direct loanword from English into Modern Hebrew. It is not of Judeo-Arabic, Ladino, or French origin. Its presence in a Djerban cookbook indicates a modern addition to the culinary repertoire, likely reflecting the assimilation of Western/American foods into the modern Israeli-Tunisian kitchen. While the name is English, the cooking method described ('generous layer of oil') suggests a technique influenced by traditional Maghrebi frying methods used for dishes like 'Ftas' or 'Sfenj', rather than the lightly greased griddle method used for American pancakes.",
