    "etymology": "While the provided name is Modern Hebrew ('Marak Yerakot'), the traditional Djerban Judeo-Arabic term for the liquid and vegetable stew served over couscous is 'Marga' (or 'Margat'). This derives from the Classical Arabic root 'm-r-q' (م-ر-ق), referring to broth or stock. In Tunisian cuisine, the technique described (sweating vegetables with spices before adding water) is known as the 'teklia' method, which forms the base of the 'Marga'. The Hebrew name is a literal translation used in Israel, but the dish's linguistic roots are firmly Maghrebi Arabic.",

    "meaning": "Broth, stew, or the liquid in which meat/vegetables are cooked",

    "sources_notes": "The Hebrew name provided is descriptive. Based on Djerban culinary tradition, the specific component is invariably called 'Marga' (often specified as 'Marga Hamra' for red/tomato or 'Marga Safra' for yellow/turmeric). The description of 'sweating' confirms the Tunisian 'teklia' base."
