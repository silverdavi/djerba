    "etymology": "The name provided, 'Ugat Shokolad' (עוגת שוקולד), is Modern Hebrew. 'Ugah' (עוגה) comes from the Biblical Hebrew root 'Ayin-Vav-Gimel' (ע-ו-ג), meaning to draw a circle or be round, referring to the shape of baked goods (seen in Genesis 18:6). 'Shokolad' is a modern loanword into Hebrew, derived from European languages (likely German 'Schokolade' or French 'Chocolat'), which ultimately traces back to the Nahuatl (Aztec) word 'xocolātl'. In the context of Djerban cuisine, chocolate cake is not an ancient indigenous dish but a modern addition, likely introduced during the French Protectorate era (1881–1956) and adapted to Kashrut laws.",
