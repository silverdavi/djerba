    "etymology": "The provided Hebrew name 'Salat Hummus' is a modern descriptive term used in Israel. The traditional name in Tunisian Judeo-Arabic is 'Slatet Homs' (سلاطة حمّص) or sometimes 'Homs bil Kamoun' (Chickpeas with Cumin). 'Homs' is the standard Arabic word for chickpeas (derived from the Semitic root ḥ-m-ṣ). 'Slatet' is derived from the Arabic 'Slata', which itself comes from the Italian 'Insalata' or Latin 'Salata', heavily reinforced by French colonial influence ('Salade'). Unlike the Levantine 'Hummus bi Tahina' (pureed dip), the Maghrebi term 'Homs' usually refers to the whole bean.",

    "meaning": "Chickpea Salad",
    "confidence": "likely",
    "sources_notes": "While the input gives the generic Hebrew name, Djerban cuisine relies on Tunisian Derja. In the context of the 'Kemia' (the array of appetizers served before Shabbat meals or with alcohol), this dish is a staple. It is distinct from 'Lablabi' (which is a hot soup), though the flavor profile is nearly identical."
