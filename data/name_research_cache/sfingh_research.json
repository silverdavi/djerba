  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "The name is derived directly from the Maghrebi Arabic word 'sfenj' (سفنج), which means 'sponge'. This Arabic term itself is a loanword derived from the Ancient Greek 'spongos' (σπόγγος), likely via the Latin 'spongia'. The name refers to the interior texture of the dough, which, when properly leavened and fried, contains large air pockets resembling a sea sponge. In the context of North African Jewish cuisine, the dish is inextricably linked to Hanukkah due to the deep-frying in oil.",
