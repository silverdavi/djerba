    "etymology": "The name is not of Judeo-Arabic or North African origin, but rather a Western loan phrase adopted into the modern Israeli-Tunisian repertoire. 'Mocha' refers to the port city of Al Mokha in Yemen (historically the center of the coffee trade), and 'Java' refers to the Indonesian island. Together, 'Mocha Java' is historically the world's oldest coffee blend. In a culinary context, 'Mocha' has come to signify the combination of chocolate and coffee. The presence of this dish in a Djerban cookbook reflects the strong French and later Western influence on Tunisian Jewish cuisine during the 20th century, where French patisserie terms were adopted and adapted for Kosher (parve) requirements.",

    "confidence": "confirmed",
    "sources_notes": "This is a modern descriptive name. Unlike traditional dishes (like 'Mhamsa' or 'Banatage'), this does not have a root in Tunisian Derja. It likely evolved from the French 'Gâteau Moka' (a popular coffee buttercream cake in France/Tunisia), adapted here to be a parve chocolate-coffee cake."
