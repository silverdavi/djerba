  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "The provided Hebrew name 'Artichoke ve Pitriot' is a modern descriptive translation. The traditional Djerban/Tunisian name for this dish is 'Gannariya' (قنارية) or 'Marqat Gannariya'. Unlike the English word 'Artichoke' (which derives from the Andalusian Arabic 'al-khurshuf'), the Tunisian word 'Gannariya' derives from the Latin 'Cynara' (or Greek 'Kinnara'), reflecting the Roman agricultural heritage of North Africa. The addition of mushrooms ('Foggâ' in dialect, though often called 'Champignon' due to French influence) suggests a later adaptation, as traditional pre-colonial stews more commonly paired artichokes with peas or fava beans.",

    "sources_notes": "The Hebrew name provided is Modern Hebrew. In the context of Djerban cuisine, dishes are named after the primary vegetable. 'Gannariya' is the specific Maghrebi term for artichoke, distinct from the Middle Eastern 'Ardi-Shawki'. The yellow turmeric and lemon base identifies this as a 'Za'ara' (yellow sauce) or 'Msharmal' (marinated) style stew."
