  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "The name is a portmanteau or compound in Judeo-Tunisian Arabic (Derja). It combines 'Adma' (عظمة), the specific Tunisian word for 'egg' (literally meaning 'bone' or 'core', distinct from the standard Arabic 'bayda'), and 'Shusha' (شوشة). In Tunisian dialect, 'Shusha' refers to a 'tuft', 'tassel' (like that on a Chechia hat), or 'disheveled hair'. The name describes the culinary result: when an egg is poached in the soup without being contained, the whites feather out into wispy strands, resembling a messy tuft or tassel floating in the broth.",
    "language_source": "tunisian_arabic",
    "root_word": "ʿAẓma (egg/bone) + Shūsha (tuft/tassel)",
    "meaning": "Tufted Egg or Tasseled Egg",
    "confidence": "likely",
    "sources_notes": "Linguistic analysis of Tunisian Derja confirms 'Adma' as the standard term for egg and 'Shusha' as a descriptor for tufts/tassels. The visual correlation between a poached egg's wispy whites and a 'shusha' is a standard metaphorical naming convention in Maghrebi dialects."
