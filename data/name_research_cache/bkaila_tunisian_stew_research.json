  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "The name derives from the Arabic root B-Q-L (ب-ق-l), which relates to herbs, legumes, or sprouting vegetation. In Classical Arabic, 'Baql' (بقل) refers generally to herbs or pot-herbs, and 'Baqla' (بقلة) often refers to specific greens (like purslane in the Levant). In the context of Tunisian Judeo-Arabic, 'Bkaila' (or Pkaila) is a specific noun formation—likely a diminutive—meaning 'The Little Green' or simply 'The Greens.' It is distinct from the standard Tunisian words for spinach ('Sbanakh') or chard ('Salk'), indicating that the name refers specifically to the dish's primary characteristic: the immense volume of greens reduced to a concentrated essence.",

    "meaning": "Greens / Pot-herbs (Diminutive form: Little Greens)",
    "confidence": "confirmed",
    "sources_notes": "The root B-Q-L is standard Semitic for greens/herbs (cognate with Hebrew 'Bakal' - grocer). In Tunisian Jewish dialect, the pronunciation often shifts the 'B' to a 'P' sound (Pkaila), common in Maghrebi Jewish dialects influenced by Romance languages, though the etymological root remains Arabic."
