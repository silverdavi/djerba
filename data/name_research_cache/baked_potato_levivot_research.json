  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "The provided name 'Levivot' (לביבות) is Biblical Hebrew, derived from the root L-B-B (ל-ב-ב), associated with the heart ('lev') or the action of kneading/mixing. In 2 Samuel 13:6, Tamar makes 'levivot' for Amnon. In Modern Hebrew, the term was adopted to refer to latkes or fritters. However, the dish described—a baked potato casserole from Djerba—is historically known in Judeo-Arabic as 'Ma'akouda' (معقودة) or 'Ma'akouda fil-Koucha' (baked Ma'akouda). The use of 'Levivot' here represents a Hebraization of the traditional dish, likely occurring after immigration to Israel, despite the cooking method (baking) differing from the standard definition of levivot (frying).",

    "root_word": "L-B-B (Hebrew) / 'A-Q-D (Arabic equivalent)",
    "meaning": "Levivot: Cakes/Heart-shaped cakes; Ma'akouda: The knotted/bound one",
    "confidence": "confirmed",
    "sources_notes": "While the Hebrew name is generic, the dish description identifies it as the Djerban/Tunisian 'Ma'akouda'. The Arabic root 'A-Q-D (to knot/tie/bind) describes how the eggs bind the mashed potato mixture together. In Tunisia, this dish is often baked in a communal oven (Koucha) rather than fried individually."
