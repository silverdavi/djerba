    "etymology": "While the Hebrew name provided ('Lechem Metugan') is a modern descriptive translation meaning 'Fried Bread,' the cultural origin of this dish in the 20th-century Tunisian Jewish context is firmly rooted in the French colonial influence. The community adopted the French term 'Pain Perdu' (Lost Bread). Unlike indigenous dishes with Judeo-Arabic names (like 'Mhamsa' or 'Pkaila'), this dish represents the Francophone acculturation of North African Jewry. The concept utilizes stale bread ('lost' bread) soaked in a custard mixture ('adma' and milk) to revive it.",

    "root_word": "Pain Perdu",
    "meaning": "Lost Bread (referring to stale bread saved from waste)",
    "confidence": "confirmed",
    "sources_notes": "Tunisia was a French protectorate (1881–1956). Tunisian Jews rapidly adopted French language and culinary habits. While fried bread exists in Sephardic history ('Rebanadas'), the specific use of vanilla-milk custard and the name 'Pain Perdu' cited in the description confirms the French colonial pathway."
