    "etymology": "The name provided is modern descriptive Hebrew rather than a traditional Judeo-Arabic term, reflecting the dish's status as a contemporary adaptation. 'Ktzi'tzot' (patties) derives from the Hebrew root K-Tz-Tz (ק-צ-ץ), meaning 'to chop' or 'cut off.' The culinary inspiration, 'Chraime' (or Hraime), comes from the Arabic root 'ḥ-r-m' (forbidden/hot), specifically the diminutive form in Libyan and Tunisian Arabic meaning 'the little hot/spicy one,' referring to the piquant paprika and garlic sauce.",
