    "etymology": "This is a Modern Hebrew descriptive name for a distinctly Western (American) dish. The word 'Muffins' (מאפינס) is a direct loanword from English into Modern Hebrew. 'Shokolad' (שוקולד) is a loanword ultimately derived from Nahuatl 'xocolātl'. 'Chemat Botnim' (חמאת בוטנים) is the Modern Hebrew calque for 'Peanut Butter'. The word 'Botnim' (בוטנים) appears in the Bible (Genesis 43:11) referring to pistachios or terebinth nuts, but was repurposed in Modern Hebrew to mean 'peanuts' (which are New World in origin). In Tunisian Arabic (Derja), peanuts are called 'Kakawiya' (from the Spanish 'cacahuete'), but this dish does not carry a Judeo-Arabic name because it is a modern addition to the repertoire, likely introduced via Israeli or French influence after emigration from Djerba.",
    "language_source": "hebrew",
    "root_word": "Muffin (English) + Shokolad (European) + Chemat Botnim (Modern Hebrew)",
    "meaning": "Chocolate and Peanut Butter Muffins",
    "confidence": "confirmed",
    "sources_notes": "This is not a traditional Djerban or Maghrebi dish. Traditional Tunisian Jewish baking relies on sponge cakes (Bouskoutou), semolina cakes (Harissa/Basbousa), or fried doughs (Yo-yos, Sfenj). The presence of peanut butter—a distinctly American ingredient—confirms this is a modern recipe adopted by the community in the diaspora (Israel or France)."
