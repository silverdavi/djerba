    "etymology": "The name provided, 'Ugat Nougat v'Botnim', is descriptive Modern Hebrew rather than a traditional Judeo-Arabic or Ladino term. This indicates the dish is likely a modern addition to the Djerban repertoire, evolved within the Israeli or French diaspora. While peanuts ('kakawiya' in Tunisian Arabic) are a traditional ingredient in North African sweets, the use of cornflakes and the specific layered structure points to modern Western influence. In French pastry (a strong influence on Tunisian cuisine), a crunchy base mixed with chocolate/praline is called a 'Croustillant' or 'Feuilletine'; this dish uses cornflakes as a kosher/accessible substitute for the traditional French 'gavottes' (crêpe dentelle).",

    "confidence": "confirmed",
    "sources_notes": "The ingredients (cornflakes, peanut butter) are modern industrial products not present in pre-20th century Djerba. The dish represents the 'Modern Israeli-Mizrahi' kitchen, adapting Western flavors (Snickers-style) to Parve (non-dairy) dietary laws for Shabbat."
