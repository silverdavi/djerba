  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "The name is purely Tunisian Arabic (Derja). 'Tbikha' derives from the Arabic triliteral root Ṭ-B-Kh (ط-ب-خ), meaning 'to cook.' In the Maghreb (Tunisia, Algeria, Libya), the noun form 'Tbikha' (طبيخة) specifically refers to a ragout or thick stew, distinct from a 'Marqa' (which implies a more liquid sauce). 'Tomatem' (طماطم) is the standard Tunisian word for tomato, ultimately derived from the Nahuatl 'tomatl' via Spanish and French. The construction 'b'Tomatem' uses the preposition 'bi' (with/in).",

In Djerba and Libya, 'Tbikha' is the standard term for a main course stew eaten with bread, whereas in Algiers, 'Tbikha' often refers specifically to a vegetarian spring stew of peas and fava beans. The Djerban usage aligns closer to the Libyan usage."
