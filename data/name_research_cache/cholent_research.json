  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "The Hebrew name 'Hamin' (חמין) is derived from Mishnaic Hebrew, originating from the Semitic root H-M-M (ח-מ-ם), meaning 'to be hot' or 'warm'. It literally translates to 'hot things' or 'warmth', referring to the rabbinic injunction to keep food warm for the Sabbath. The English/Yiddish name 'Cholent', while Ashkenazi, is widely accepted to derive from Old French 'chault' (hot) and 'lent' (slow), reflecting the cooking method. In the specific context of Djerban and Tunisian Jewry, while 'Hamin' is the religious term, the dish is historically known as 'Tfina' or 'Dafina'.",
