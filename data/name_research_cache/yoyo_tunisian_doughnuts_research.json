  "name_origin": {
    "etymology": "The name 'Yoyo' is widely attributed to the French colonial influence in Tunisia (1881–1956). It is named after the toy 'yo-yo,' which became a global craze in the 1920s and 1930s. The shape of the pastry (a ring, sometimes appearing like two disks joined depending on how the dough puffs) resembled the toy. While the recipe itself—a fried dough soaked in syrup—has older roots in Andalusian and Ottoman confectionery (related to 'Rosquillas'), the specific nomenclature 'Yoyo' is a loan word adopted into Tunisian dialect (Derja) and Judeo-Arabic from French.",
    "language_source": "french",
    "root_word": "Yo-yo (the toy)",
    "meaning": "Named after the toy due to the round shape with a hole",
    "confidence": "likely",
    "sources_notes": "Common consensus among Maghrebi culinary historians is that the name dates to the French Protectorate era. The dish is distinct from the Arabic 'Sfenj' or 'Bambalouni' because it is a cake doughnut (using baking powder/eggs) rather than a yeast dough, reflecting European pastry techniques adapted to local tastes (honey/syrup soaking)."
