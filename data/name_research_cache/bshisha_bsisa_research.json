    "etymology": "The name derives directly from the Arabic root B-S-S (ب س س). The verb 'bassa' (بَسَّ) means to mix or moisten flour with oil, clarified butter (smen), or water. It specifically describes the action of rubbing the fat into the flour to create a texture that is neither a dry powder nor a fully kneaded dough, but a crumbly or sandy paste. This is an ancient Semitic root found in Classical Arabic referring to a mixture of wheat and barley carried by travelers.",

    "sources_notes": "The term is standard in Maghrebi dialects (Tunisian Derja, Libyan Arabic). In the Djerban Jewish dialect, the pronunciation often shifts slightly to 'Bshisha' or 'Pshisha' due to the phonetic emphasis on the first consonant cluster. The dish is historically significant in the Maghreb as a non-perishable travel food."
