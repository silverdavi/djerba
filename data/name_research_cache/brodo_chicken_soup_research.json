    "etymology": "The term 'Brodo' is a direct loanword from Italian, retained in Tunisian dialect (Derja) and specifically Tunisian Judeo-Arabic. Tunisia hosted a significant population of Livornese Jews (the 'Grana') and Sicilian immigrants, whose language heavily influenced local culinary terminology. While 'Shorba' is the general Arabic term for soup, and 'Marqa' for stew, 'Brodo' specifically refers to a clear, light bouillon or stock (usually chicken or beef with root vegetables) that is not heavily spiced with red pepper or tomato paste. It is linguistically distinct from the Spanish/Ladino 'Caldo'.",
    "language_source": "other",
    "root_word": "Italian 'brodo' (from Late Latin 'brodum', of Germanic origin)",
    "meaning": "Broth or stock",
    "confidence": "confirmed",
    "sources_notes": "The presence of Italian loanwords in Tunisian culinary vocabulary is well-documented due to the Grana community and geographic proximity to Sicily. The usage of 'Brodo' in Tunisia is distinct from the French 'Bouillon' or the Spanish 'Caldo'."
