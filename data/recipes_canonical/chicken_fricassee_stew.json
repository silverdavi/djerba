  "name_hebrew": "צ׳יקן פריקסה",
  "name_origin": "The name provided is a linguistic hybrid, indicating a modern or diasporic evolution rather than an ancient Judeo-Arabic root. 'Chicken' (צ׳יקן) is a direct transliteration of the English word, which is not native to Djerban or Tunisian dialects (where chicken is 'djaj'). 'Fricassee' (פריקסה) derives from the French culinary term 'fricassée' (from the Middle French 'frire' [to fry] and 'casser' [to break/cut up]). While 'Fricassé' in Tunisia almost exclusively refers to the famous fried sandwich, the French colonial influence (1881–1956) introduced the classic French 'fricassée' stew to the Jewish bourgeoisie. The presence of 'dumplings' suggests this may be a variation of a 'Ragout' or 'Marqa' adapted with European techniques, or a family-specific name for a dish resembling American 'Chicken and Dumplings'.",

The stew features large, golden-brown chunks of seitan that resemble tender chicken, simmered alongside soft, orange carrot rounds and translucent onions. Fluffy, irregular white flour dumplings float on the surface of the rich, golden-hued vegetable broth, glistening with droplets of oil. Fresh parsley is scattered on top for color. The lighting is warm and natural, streaming from a nearby window with iron bars, illuminating the steam rising from the hot dish. In the background, blurred limestone walls and vintage copper cookware hanging on hooks suggest a traditional Old City home setting. The texture looks thick and comforting, highlighting the wholesome, plant-based adaptation of this classic diasporic comfort food, inviting the viewer to dip a spoon into the savory sauce."
