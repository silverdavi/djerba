  "name": "Msiyar (Tunisian Pickled Vegetables)",
  "name_hebrew": "משייר",
  "name_origin": "The name derives from the Maghrebi Arabic root Ṣ-Y-R (ص-ي-ر), specifically the form II verb 'ṣayyar' (صيّر), which means to preserve, cure, or pickle (usually in salt and lemon rather than vinegar). The word 'Msiyar' (or Msayyar) is the passive participle meaning 'preserved' or 'cured.' While in Morocco and Algeria the cognate term 'M'sir' refers almost exclusively to preserved lemons, in Tunisian Jewish usage, it applies to this specific quick-pickled salad of peppers and carrots cured in lemon juice. (Confidence: likely)",

The bowl contains uniform strips of glossy red, yellow, and orange bell peppers mixed with bright orange carrot sticks and pale green kohlrabi slices. Small chunks of yellow lemon with the rind are scattered throughout the mix, submerged in a clear, glistening brine that catches the light. The vegetables look crisp and crunchy, emphasizing their raw freshness. The setting is an atmospheric stone kitchen in Safed from the early 1900s, featuring a textured limestone wall in the background and a worn, dark wooden table. A small clay dish of coarse salt, a vintage knife, and a few whole lemons sit nearby as props to suggest preparation. The lighting is soft, diffused daylight coming from a side window, highlighting the fresh textures of this naturally vegan appetizer and capturing the essence of a traditional North African kemia spread served in a historic home."
