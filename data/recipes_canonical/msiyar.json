  "name": "Msiyar (Tunisian Pickled Vegetables)",
  "name_hebrew": "משייר",
  "name_origin": "The name derives from the Maghrebi Arabic root Ṣ-Y-R (ص-ي-ر), specifically the form II verb 'ṣayyar' (صيّر), which means to preserve, cure, or pickle (usually in salt and lemon rather than vinegar). The word 'Msiyar' (or Msayyar) is the passive participle meaning 'preserved' or 'cured.' While in Morocco and Algeria the cognate term 'M'sir' refers almost exclusively to preserved lemons, in Tunisian Jewish usage, it applies to this specific quick-pickled salad of peppers and carrots cured in lemon juice. (Confidence: likely)",
  "description": "A traditional Tunisian quick-pickled vegetable salad. Crunchy strips of peppers, carrots, and lemon are cured in a simple brine of lemon juice, water, and coarse salt. It is a staple appetizer (kemia) on the Djerban table.",
