The rice is golden from soy sauce with visible pieces of crispy tofu, sliced mushrooms, and bright green scallion rings scattered throughout. Wisps of steam rise from the hot dish. The bowl sits on a dark wooden table in an early 1900s Safed stone kitchen. A pair of wooden chopsticks rest beside the bowl. Soft natural light highlights the glistening grains. The atmosphere blends Asian culinary tradition with the historic setting."
