  "name": "Sfenj (Maghrebi Doughnuts)",
  "name_hebrew": "שפינג׳ות",
  "name_origin": "The name is derived directly from the Arabic word 'isfanj' (سفنج), meaning 'sponge', referring to the dough's porous, airy interior texture when fried. The Arabic term itself is a loanword from the Ancient Greek 'spongos' (σπόγγος). In Maghrebi dialects (Tunisian Derja and Moroccan Darija), the initial vowel is dropped, resulting in 'Sfenj'. The Hebrew form provided, 'Sfinjot' (שפינג׳ות), is a Judeo-Arabic hybridization, applying the Hebrew feminine plural suffix '-ot' to the Arabic noun.",
  "description": "Traditional North African deep-fried yeast doughnuts. These rustic fritters have a spongy interior and a crispy exterior, typically eaten plain or sprinkled with sugar.",
  "cultural_context": "A staple street food in Morocco and Tunisia. In Jewish tradition, Sfenj are widely consumed during Hanukkah to celebrate the miracle of the oil, and are also a popular breakfast or tea-time treat.",
