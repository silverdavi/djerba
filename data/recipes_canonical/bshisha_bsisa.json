  "name_hebrew": "בשישה",
  "name_origin": "The name derives directly from the Arabic root B-S-S (ب س س). The verb 'bassa' (بَسَّ) means to mix or moisten flour with oil, clarified butter (smen), or water. It specifically describes the action of rubbing the fat into the flour to create a texture that is neither a dry powder nor a fully kneaded dough, but a crumbly or sandy paste. This is an ancient Semitic root found in Classical Arabic referring to a mixture of wheat and barley carried by travelers.",
  "description": "A traditional North African energy food made from roasted and ground wheat and barley, spiced with aromatic seeds. It is mixed with olive oil and dates (or sugar) to form a paste or energy balls. Traditionally eaten on Rosh Chodesh Nissan to symbolize the opening of the gates of livelihood.",
  "cultural_context": "Eaten on the night of Rosh Chodesh Nissan in North African Jewish communities (Libya, Tunisia, Djerba). A specific tradition involves stirring the mixture with a key (often a gold key or the house key) while reciting 'Ya Fattah' or the phrase 'Patah u'zrak hal b'ban' (Open and throw [sustenance] through the door), asking God to open the gates of sustenance.",

Center stage is a handmade ceramic bowl filled with Bshisha, a textured deep golden-brown paste made of roasted ground wheat and barley. Several round energy balls formed from the mixture sit alongside the bowl on a weathered wooden board, showcasing a dense and crumbly texture. A small antique gold key rests symbolically inside the main bowl of paste, half-submerged. Surrounding the dish are small clay bowls containing whole coriander seeds, cumin, and sticky chopped dates. A vintage glass bottle of golden olive oil stands nearby, catching the light. The texture of the Bshisha looks sandy yet moist, rich with oil and aromatic spices. The background features rough limestone walls and a colorful woven tablecloth with North African patterns, evoking a traditional Jewish atmosphere within the historic Galilee setting."
