  "name": "Charoset",
  "name_hebrew": "חרוסת",
  "name_origin": "The name is derived from the Mishnaic Hebrew word 'cheres' (חרס), which translates to 'clay', 'earthenware', or 'shard'. This etymology is explicitly cited in the Babylonian Talmud (Pesachim 116a), where the dish is described as symbolizing the clay or mortar used by the Israelites to make bricks during their enslavement in Egypt. The texture and color of the paste are intended to visually mimic this mortar.",
  "description": "A sweet, dark paste made of fruits and nuts eaten at the Passover Seder. It symbolizes the mortar used by the Israelites during their enslavement in Egypt. This version combines the richness of Medjool dates with the texture of apples and nuts.",
  "cultural_context": "While Ashkenazi Charoset is typically apple-based, North African (Tunisian and Moroccan) versions often rely on dates as the primary binder. This recipe bridges the two styles or represents a specific family variation using both.",

While North African versions traditionally rely on dates, this recipe blends that richness with the crunch of apples and nuts.
