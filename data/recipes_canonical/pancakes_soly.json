  "name_hebrew": "פנקייק סולי",
  "name_origin": "The name is a modern construct found in Israeli/Diaspora Jewish culture rather than a traditional North African dialect. It combines the English loanword 'Pancake' (transliterated phonetically into Hebrew as פנקייק) with the possessive nickname 'Soly'. 'Soly' is a common affectionate diminutive for the name Solomon (Shlomo) among North African (Sephardic/Mizrahi) Jews. The use of the English loanword instead of traditional Tunisian terms like 'Ghraif' or 'Baghrir' indicates this is a Western recipe adopted by the family and adapted to be Kosher Parve, rather than an indigenous Djerban dish.",
  "description": "A simple, dairy-free pancake recipe. By using water and oil instead of milk and butter, these pancakes are 'Parve' (kosher neutral), making them suitable to serve after a meat meal or for those avoiding dairy.",
  "cultural_context": "The use of 'bags' for baking powder and vanilla sugar indicates an Israeli influence on the family cooking, where these ingredients are sold in standard 10g packets.",

The pancakes appear light and airy, with crisp, lacy edges and a soft interior visible from a cut section. Rich amber maple syrup flows generously down the stack, pooling on the plate, garnished with a few fresh mint leaves and a light dusting of powdered sugar. The scene is set within an authentic early 1900s stone kitchen in Safed, featuring rough-hewn limestone walls and a deep arched window sill. Soft, diffused morning sunlight streams in, illuminating the steam rising from the hot cakes. On the weathered wooden table surrounding the plate, there are subtle hints of the preparation: a small jar of ground flaxseed, a vintage wire whisk, and a linen napkin. The composition emphasizes the rustic warmth of the home and the appetizing texture of this plant-based adaptation, blending traditional atmosphere with modern culinary ethics."
