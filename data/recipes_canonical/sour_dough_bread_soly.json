  "name_hebrew": "לחם מחמצת של סולי",
  "name_origin": "The name provided is Modern Hebrew. 'Lechem' (לחם) means bread. 'Machmetzet' (מחמצת) refers to a sourdough starter or leaven. The root is H-M-Tz (ח-מ-צ), which relates to 'chametz' (leavened food forbidden on Passover) and 'chumtzah' (acid/sourness). Historically, in Djerba and Tunisia, bread was naturally leavened using a piece of old dough called 'khmira' (Arabic) or 'levain' (French), rather than the modern liquid starter implied by the Hebrew word 'machmetzet'. This specific title likely reflects a modern Israeli-Hebrew naming convention for a traditional family recipe.",
  "description": "A classic rustic sourdough bread recipe relying on natural fermentation. It features a long cold proof in the refrigerator to develop deep flavors and a crispy crust.",
  "cultural_context": "Bread making is a staple in Jewish households, often associated with preparation for Shabbat or daily sustenance. This recipe utilizes a natural starter (levain) rather than commercial yeast.",

The Hebrew term *machmetzet* refers to the sour leaven, recalling the traditional Djerban practice of preserving *khmira*—a piece of old dough—to rise the next batch. A long cold proof develops the deep, tangy flavor that makes this bread a daily essential."
