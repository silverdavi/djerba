  "name_hebrew": "עוגת דבש (מאמי)",
  "name_origin": "The term 'Mami' (מאמי) in this context is not a specific culinary root but a familial honorific derived from the French 'Mamie' (Grandma). Following the French Protectorate in Tunisia (1881–1956), many Tunisian Jewish families adopted French familial terms. The cake itself—a soft honey cake using coffee and spices—is likely a local adaptation of the French 'Pain d'épices' or an adoption of the Ashkenazi 'Lekach' which became popular in Israel and the diaspora, rather than an ancient Djerban dish (which would typically be 'Boulou'). The Hebrew 'Ougat Dvash' is a modern descriptive translation. (Confidence: likely)",

The setting is a sunlit stone kitchen in early 1900s Safed with textured limestone walls in the background.
