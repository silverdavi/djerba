  "name": "Judy's Biscotti",
  "name_hebrew": "ביסקוטי ג׳ודי",
  "name_origin": "The name is a modern hybrid. 'Biscotti' is the plural of the Italian 'biscotto', derived from the Latin 'bis' (twice) and 'coctus' (cooked/baked). However, in the context of Tunisian cuisine (influenced by the Livornese 'Grana' Jews and French colonialism), the term 'biscuit' or 'biscotto' was Arabized into 'Bachkoutou' (bash-koo-too), referring generically to cookies. The specific name 'Judy' refers to the family member who created this variation. The description indicates this is not a true twice-baked biscotti, but rather a 'Mandelbrot' style loaf-cookie adapted with oil (parve) and chocolate chips, reflecting a fusion of North African pareve baking traditions with modern Western ingredients.",
  "description": "A rich, oil-based cookie loaded with chocolate chips. Unlike traditional Italian biscotti, this recipe (likely a variation of Jewish Mandelbrot) uses oil instead of butter, making it Parve. The dough is naturally crumbly, resulting in a tender, shortbread-like texture.",
  "cultural_context": "While called 'Biscotti', this is likely a North African or Sephardic take on Mandelbrot (Mandel bread). The use of oil instead of butter is typical in Jewish baking to ensure the dessert is Parve (kosher to eat after a meat meal).",
