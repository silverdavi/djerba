  "name_hebrew": "פנקייק (אפרת שחור)",
  "name_origin": "The name 'Pancake' (פנקייק) is a direct loanword from English into Modern Hebrew. It is not of Judeo-Arabic, Ladino, or French origin. Its presence in a Djerban cookbook indicates a modern addition to the culinary repertoire, likely reflecting the assimilation of Western/American foods into the modern Israeli-Tunisian kitchen. While the name is English, the cooking method described ('generous layer of oil') suggests a technique influenced by traditional Maghrebi frying methods used for dishes like 'Ftas' or 'Sfenj', rather than the lightly greased griddle method used for American pancakes.",
  "description": "A fluffy, comforting pancake recipe featuring chocolate chips. The batter is rested briefly to ensure airiness and fried in a generous layer of oil, resulting in a crispy exterior and a soft, melt-in-your-mouth interior.",
  "cultural_context": "A modern family favorite likely adopted into the repertoire, distinguished by the frying method (using a 'nice layer' of oil rather than a lightly greased pan), which is typical of North African cooking styles applied to Western dishes.",
  "is_vegan": true,

The pancakes are thick and fluffy, studded with melting dark vegan chocolate chips. They have a distinctively crispy, fried exterior edge, glistening slightly from the generous oil used in the Maghrebi frying technique, differing from the smooth surface of American pancakes. A drizzle of maple syrup cascades down the side. The setting is an authentic early 20th-century stone kitchen in Safed, with textured limestone walls and soft, natural window light illuminating the steam rising from the hot dish. In the background, a vintage copper frying pan sits on a stove. The color palette features warm golds, deep chocolate browns, and the earthy tones of the stone surroundings."
