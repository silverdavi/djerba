  "name_origin": "The term 'Brikot' is the Hebraized plural form of the Tunisian Arabic word 'Brik' (بريك). The root of the word is definitively traced to the Ottoman Turkish 'Börek', a general term for filled pastries. The Ottoman Empire controlled Tunisia from the 16th to the 19th century, introducing the concept of phyllo/yufka doughs. In Tunisia, this evolved into the 'Malsouka' (the specific leaf) and the dish became 'Brik'. The suffix '-ot' (ות) is the Hebrew feminine plural marker, indicating that 'Brikot' is the specific terminology used by Tunisian Jews (and subsequently in Israel) to refer to multiple pieces of the pastry.",
  "description": "A quintessential Tunisian savory pastry consisting of a thin, crispy dough sheet (Malsouka) wrapped around a filling and deep-fried. The most traditional fillings are a whole egg or savory mashed potatoes.",
  "cultural_context": "Djerban/Tunisian Jewish tradition. Brik is a staple of Tunisian cuisine, often served as an appetizer for Shabbat dinners, holidays, and breaking the fast during Ramadan. The 'Egg Brik' requires skill to keep the yolk runny while the pastry becomes crispy.",
