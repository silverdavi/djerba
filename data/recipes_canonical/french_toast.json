  "name_hebrew": "לחם מטוגן",
  "name_origin": "While the Hebrew name provided ('Lechem Metugan') is a modern descriptive translation meaning 'Fried Bread,' the cultural origin of this dish in the 20th-century Tunisian Jewish context is firmly rooted in the French colonial influence. The community adopted the French term 'Pain Perdu' (Lost Bread). Unlike indigenous dishes with Judeo-Arabic names (like 'Mhamsa' or 'Pkaila'), this dish represents the Francophone acculturation of North African Jewry. The concept utilizes stale bread ('lost' bread) soaked in a custard mixture ('adma' and milk) to revive it.",
  "description": "A classic breakfast dish made by dipping sliced bread into a custard of eggs, milk, and vanilla, then frying until golden brown. A perfect way to use up stale bread.",
  "cultural_context": "In North African Jewish communities with French influence (Tunisia, Morocco), this is often known as 'Pain Perdu'. In Israel, it is a standard household dinner or breakfast known as 'Lechem Metugan'.",
