  "name": "Bkaila (Tunisian Chard and Bean Stew)",
  "name_hebrew": "בקילה",
  "name_origin": "The name derives from the Arabic root B-Q-L (ب-ق-l), which relates to herbs, legumes, or sprouting vegetation. In Classical Arabic, 'Baql' (بقل) refers generally to herbs or pot-herbs, and 'Baqla' (بقلة) often refers to specific greens (like purslane in the Levant). In the context of Tunisian Judeo-Arabic, 'Bkaila' (or Pkaila) is a specific noun formation—likely a diminutive—meaning 'The Little Green' or simply 'The Greens.' It is distinct from the standard Tunisian words for spinach ('Sbanakh') or chard ('Salk'), indicating that the name refers specifically to the dish's primary characteristic: the immense volume of greens reduced to a concentrated essence.",
  "description": "A rich, traditional Tunisian Jewish stew characterized by its deep, dark green color. The unique flavor comes from slowly frying Swiss chard (or spinach) until it creates a concentrated confit, which is then simmered with white beans, beef, and fresh herbs.",
  "cultural_context": "A staple of Tunisian Jewish cuisine, traditionally served on Shabbat or holidays. The preparation of the greens (the 'pkaila' base) is a technique specific to this community.",
  "is_vegan": false,
  "vegan_adaptation_notes": "Replace beef with extra beans or potatoes; the dark chard confit provides enough richness for a hearty vegan dish.",
