  "name_origin": "The word 'Schnitzel' is of German origin, derived from the verb 'schnitzen', meaning 'to carve' or 'to cut'. The suffix '-el' is a diminutive, so the word literally translates to 'a little cut' or 'a slice'. While the dish originated in Austria (Wiener Schnitzel, made with veal), it was brought to Israel by Central European (Ashkenazi) immigrants. In Israel, due to the scarcity of veal, turkey and chicken became the standard proteins. It was subsequently adopted by North African Jewish communities (including Djerbans) in Israel and France, often replacing more complex traditional fried dishes due to its convenience and popularity with children.",
  "description": "Thinly pounded chicken breasts coated in seasoned breadcrumbs and fried until golden and crispy. While originally a European dish, it has become a ubiquitous staple in Israeli and North African Jewish kitchens, often served for Shabbat lunch.",
  "cultural_context": "Adopted by North African Jewish families in Israel and the diaspora, often replacing traditional fried fish or meat patties. It is typically served with couscous, mashed potatoes, or Israeli salad.",
