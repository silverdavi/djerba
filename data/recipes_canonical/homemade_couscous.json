  "name": "Homemade Couscous",
  "name_hebrew": "קוסקוס",
  "name_origin": "The word derives from the Berber (Amazigh) language, specifically the word 'seksu' or 'kesksu'. It entered North African Arabic as 'kuskusi' and later French/English as 'couscous'. While some theories suggest an onomatopoeic origin (the sound of the steam or the sieve), the linguistic consensus points to the Berber root S-K-S, referring to the action of rolling or rounding the wheat granules.",
  "description": "Traditional handmade couscous prepared from raw semolina. Unlike instant varieties, this involves hydrating, rolling, and steaming the grains twice to achieve a light, fluffy texture.",
  "cultural_context": "The cornerstone of North African Jewish cuisine, particularly in Djerba and Tunisia. It is traditionally prepared on Fridays to be served with vegetable and meat soup for Shabbat lunch.",

The tiny semolina grains are distinct, light, and golden-yellow, glistening slightly with vegetable oil, showing the result of careful hand-rolling. Next to the main bowl is a smaller clay pot containing a vibrant, rich vegetable stew with chunks of orange pumpkin, carrots, zucchini, and chickpeas, emitting soft steam. The setting is an authentic early 20th-century stone kitchen in Safed, Israel, featuring rough-hewn limestone walls and a heavy wooden work table worn smooth by time. Soft, natural light streams from a small arched window, illuminating the steam rising from the hot grains and casting gentle shadows. A vintage brass sieve and a wooden spoon rest on the table, hinting at the traditional preparation method. The atmosphere is warm, inviting, and purely plant-based, capturing the essence of a traditional North African Shabbat lunch prepared with artisanal care."
