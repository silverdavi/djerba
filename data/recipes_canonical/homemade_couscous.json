  "name_hebrew": "קוסקוס",
  "name_origin": "The word derives from the Berber (Amazigh) language, specifically the word 'seksu' or 'kesksu'. It entered North African Arabic as 'kuskusi' and later French/English as 'couscous'. While some theories suggest an onomatopoeic origin (the sound of the steam or the sieve), the linguistic consensus points to the Berber root S-K-S, referring to the action of rolling or rounding the wheat granules.",

  "cultural_context": "The cornerstone of North African Jewish cuisine, particularly in Djerba and Tunisia. It is traditionally prepared on Fridays to be served with vegetable and meat soup for Shabbat lunch.",
