  "name_origin": "The Hebrew name 'Lechem Bayit' is a direct calque (loan translation) of the Maghrebi Arabic term 'Khobz Dar' (خبز دار) or the French 'Pain de Maison'. In North African culture, a distinct separation exists between 'Khobz Souq' (market bread/baguettes bought daily) and 'Khobz Dar' (bread made by the housewife). While the name provided is Modern Hebrew, the culinary concept is strictly North African: a dense, soft-crumbed loaf baked in a home oven rather than a communal tannur or bought from a bakery.",
  "description": "A classic, simple white bread recipe using a standard 1kg flour base. This recipe produces a reliable dough suitable for loaves or rolls.",
  "cultural_context": "In North African Jewish households, baking bread is a weekly staple, often done on Fridays for Shabbat (Challah). While this recipe does not specify eggs (common in Ashkenazi Challah), water-based breads are common for daily consumption or specific Sephardic traditions.",

The bread features a golden-brown crust with a soft and airy interior visible through a torn section, revealing its fluffy texture. A light dusting of flour clings to the surface. The setting evokes an early 20th-century Safed home with textured limestone walls in the background. Beside the bread sits a small ceramic bowl of olive oil and coarse salt for dipping. The lighting is warm and natural, highlighting the steam rising from the warm bread. The composition emphasizes the homemade, artisanal quality of this naturally plant-based staple, capturing the essence of traditional North African baking adapted to the Galilee."
