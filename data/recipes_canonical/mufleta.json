The thin, layered crepes glisten with oil and show beautiful golden-brown spots from frying. NO PEOPLE in the image. A small bowl of golden date honey and a dish of soft vegan butter sit nearby. The setting is an early 1900s Safed stone kitchen with rough limestone walls and worn wooden table. Soft morning light streams through an arched window, illuminating the delicate layers of the crepes. Fresh mint leaves garnish the scene. The atmosphere evokes the joy of Mimouna celebration. Food photography, high detail, no humans."
