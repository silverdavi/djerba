  "name_origin": "The name 'Yoyo' is widely attributed to the French colonial influence in Tunisia (1881–1956). It is named after the toy 'yo-yo,' which became a global craze in the 1920s and 1930s. The shape of the pastry (a ring, sometimes appearing like two disks joined depending on how the dough puffs) resembled the toy. While the recipe itself—a fried dough soaked in syrup—has older roots in Andalusian and Ottoman confectionery (related to 'Rosquillas'), the specific nomenclature 'Yoyo' is a loan word adopted into Tunisian dialect (Derja) and Judeo-Arabic from French. (Confidence: likely)",
