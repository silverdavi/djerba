  "name": "Sfingh (Sfenj)",
  "name_hebrew": "ספינג'",
  "name_origin": "The name is derived directly from the Maghrebi Arabic word 'sfenj' (سفنج), which means 'sponge'. This Arabic term itself is a loanword derived from the Ancient Greek 'spongos' (σπόγγος), likely via the Latin 'spongia'. The name refers to the interior texture of the dough, which, when properly leavened and fried, contains large air pockets resembling a sea sponge. In the context of North African Jewish cuisine, the dish is inextricably linked to Hanukkah due to the deep-frying in oil.",
  "description": "Traditional Maghrebi deep-fried dough rings, similar to rustic doughnuts. They feature a crispy exterior and a spongy, airy interior. Typically eaten plain or dipped in sugar, often served for Hanukkah or as a special breakfast treat.",
  "cultural_context": "A staple of North African Jewish cuisine (Moroccan, Tunisian, Djerban). Because they are fried in oil, they are particularly associated with the holiday of Hanukkah, though they are enjoyed year-round.",

The cinnamon coating is prominently visible, giving the doughnuts a warm spiced color. Some rings are torn open to reveal the sponge-like interior. The setting is an old stone kitchen in Safed with limestone walls. Soft natural light illuminates the cinnamon-sugar crystals. A small bowl of cinnamon sticks sits nearby. The scene evokes warmth and tradition of this plant-based Hanukkah treat."
