  "name_hebrew": "קראמבל תפוחים",
  "name_origin": "The name 'Crumble Tapuchim' (קראמבל תפוחים) is a Modern Hebrew construction. 'Crumble' is a direct transliteration of the English culinary term, which originated in Britain during World War II as a rationing-friendly alternative to pies. 'Tapuchim' is the Hebrew plural for apples (from the root n-p-ch, meaning to blow or swell). This dish is not indigenous to North African Jewish cuisine. Its presence in a Djerban cookbook indicates modern culinary assimilation, likely introduced via the French Jewish diaspora (where 'Le Crumble' became extremely popular in the 1980s) or through modern Israeli culture.",
  "description": "A comforting dessert featuring tender sliced apples spiced with cinnamon and sugar, topped with a crunchy oat and flour crumble. This version uses margarine to keep it pareve, making it suitable for serving after meat meals.",
  "cultural_context": "While Western in origin, apple crumble is a staple in many Jewish households for Shabbat and holidays because it is easily made pareve (non-dairy).",

The dessert features tender baked apples bubbling with dark, cinnamon-spiced syrup underneath a highly textured, crispy topping of rolled oats and flour. Soft, warm natural light streams through a deep-set arched stone window, illuminating the steam gently rising from the hot dish and casting soft shadows on the limestone walls. Nearby, a vintage tarnished silver spoon, a small bowl of loose oats, and a few scattered raw apples with cinnamon sticks add to the culinary atmosphere. The scene captures the comforting warmth of a traditional home, highlighting the rich, crunchy textures of the 100% plant-based crumble topping. The composition focuses on the wholesome, earthy colors of the baked fruit and grains, presenting an inviting and authentic moment of culinary history adapted for modern plant-based living."
