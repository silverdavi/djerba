  "name": "Marmouma (Tunisian Cooked Tomato and Pepper Salad)",
  "name_hebrew": "מרמומה",
  "name_origin": "The name 'Marmouma' (مرمومة) is specific to the Tunisian (specifically Southern/Djerban) and Libyan Arabic dialects. It is distinct from the more generic 'Matbucha' (which simply means 'cooked' in Arabic). The etymology likely stems from a dialectal variation of roots describing the texture of the dish—vegetables that are broken down, mashed, or stewed until soft. In the context of Djerban and Libyan cuisine, it refers specifically to a cooked salad where the ingredients are stewed in a pot rather than grilled first (which would be 'Mechouia'). (Confidence: likely)",
  "description": "A classic Tunisian cooked salad made from fresh tomatoes, sweet and hot peppers, and plenty of garlic. Similar to Matbucha, it is slow-cooked until the liquids evaporate, resulting in a rich, jam-like consistency.",
  "cultural_context": "A staple of the Djerban and Tunisian Jewish table, traditionally served as part of the 'kemia' (appetizer spread) for Shabbat meals alongside bread.",
