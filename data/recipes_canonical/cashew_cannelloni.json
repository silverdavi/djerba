The pasta tubes are visible under a bubbly, slightly charred tomato sauce with bright green basil leaves. Creamy white cashew filling peeks from the ends of the tubes. The dish sits on a worn wooden table in an early 1900s Safed stone kitchen. Soft natural light highlights the steam rising from the hot pasta. A vintage silver serving spoon rests beside the dish. The atmosphere is warm and inviting."
