  "name_hebrew": "סופגניות",
  "name_origin": "The word derives from the Hebrew root S-F-G (ס-פ-ג), meaning 'to absorb' or 'sponge,' referring to the dough's spongy texture and its absorption of oil during deep-frying. The term 'Sufgan' (סופגן) appears in the Mishnah (Challah 1:4) and Tosefta referring to a spongy dough. The modern form 'Sufganiyah' was standardized by the Hebrew Language Committee (likely David Yellin) in the early 20th century to describe the Hanukkah doughnut. It shares an ancient etymological link with the Greek word 'spongos' and the Maghrebi Arabic word 'Sfenj'.",
