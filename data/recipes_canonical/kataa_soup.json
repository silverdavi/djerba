  "name_hebrew": "קטעה",
  "name_origin": "Derived directly from the Arabic triconsonantal root Q-Ṭ-ʿ (ق-ط-ع), which encompasses meanings of 'cutting', 'chopping', 'tearing', or 'severing'. In Tunisian Arabic (Derja), the word 'Qat'a' (قطعة) literally means 'a piece' or 'a slice'. The dish name refers to the method of preparation where the fresh dough is manually torn or pinched into irregular 'pieces' before being dropped into the broth. It is linguistically and culinarily cognate with the broader Maghrebi term 'Mqatfa' (meaning 'the cut things' or 'cut pasta'), but the Djerban Jewish nomenclature preserves the noun form 'Kata'a' (Piece). (Confidence: likely)",
  "description": "A traditional rustic Tunisian soup made with handmade fresh dough pieces boiled in a savory broth. The dish is similar to Mhamsa or Dwida but uses fresh, irregularly shaped dough pinched by hand directly into the boiling water, finished with a flour slurry for a thick, comforting texture.",
  "cultural_context": "A Djerban/Tunisian comfort food. The recipe references 'Mhamsa, Shmid, Dwida', which are other traditional pasta-based soups, indicating this is part of the same family of starch-heavy, warming winter dishes.",

The soup features irregular, hand-torn pieces of soft white dough floating in a glossy, slightly thickened golden broth. Steam rises gently from the hot liquid. The texture of the soup looks creamy from the flour slurry. Freshly ground black pepper speckles the surface. The bowl sits on a worn wooden table inside an early 20th-century stone kitchen in Safed, with soft natural light filtering through a small window, illuminating the steam. In the background, a vintage metal pot sits on a stove, and a small mound of flour rests on the table, emphasizing the handmade nature of the dish. The atmosphere is warm, comforting, and humble."
