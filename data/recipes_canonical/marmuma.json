  "name_hebrew": "מרמומה",
  "name_origin": "The name 'Marmouma' (or Marmouma) is specific to Tunisian Arabic (Derja). It likely derives from the Arabic root 'r-m-m' (رمم) or 'r-m' which can imply repairing or, in a dialectal sense, something that has been broken down or reduced. In the culinary context, it refers to the vegetables being cooked down until they lose their individual structure and become a cohesive, jam-like spread. It is linguistically distinct from the Moroccan 'Matbucha' (which simply means 'cooked'), though the dish is nearly identical. Some linguistic theories suggest a corruption of 'Maghmouma' (مغمومة), meaning 'smothered' or 'covered', referring to the cooking method of simmering in a covered pot to reduce the liquid, but 'Marmouma' is the established term in Tunisia. (Confidence: likely)",
  "description": "A classic Tunisian cooked salad made of tomatoes, hot peppers, and garlic, simmered slowly until it reaches a rich, jam-like consistency. It is a staple of the Djerban Jewish table, typically served as part of the kemia (appetizer course) with challah or bread.",
  "cultural_context": "This dish is central to Tunisian and Djerban Jewish cuisine. While similar to the Moroccan Matbucha, Marmuma often focuses heavily on the slow reduction of tomatoes and peppers to concentrate the flavors. The 8-hour cooking time mentioned in the original recipe suggests a traditional slow-cooking method to achieve a deep, confit-like texture.",
