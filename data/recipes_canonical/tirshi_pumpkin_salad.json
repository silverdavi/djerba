  "name": "Tirshi (Tunisian Pumpkin Salad)",
  "name_hebrew": "תירשי",
  "name_origin": "Derived from the Arabic word 'turshi' (طرشي), which generally means 'pickles' or 'pickled vegetables' throughout the Middle East and Maghreb. The word ultimately traces back to the Persian 'torsh' (ترش) meaning 'sour' or 'acidic'. In the context of Tunisian and Libyan Jewish cuisine, the meaning shifted from whole pickled vegetables to a specific cooked, mashed salad (usually pumpkin or carrot) that is heavily seasoned with vinegar or lemon juice, garlic, and caraway (karwiya). The name refers to the sour, pungent flavor profile that functions like a pickle to cut through the richness of Shabbat stews or couscous, rather than the texture.",
  "description": "A classic Tunisian Jewish cooked salad made from mashed pumpkin, garlic, and spices. It is traditionally served cold or at room temperature as part of the 'kemia' (appetizer spread) on Shabbat and holidays.",
  "cultural_context": "A staple of Djerban and Tunisian cuisine. While 'Tirshi' can refer to various pickled vegetables in other Middle Eastern contexts, for Tunisian Jews, it almost exclusively refers to this specific pumpkin dip. It is known for its vibrant orange color and bold flavor profile.",

The texture is rustic and mashed, glistening with a generous drizzle of golden olive oil and garnished with fresh chopped parsley and a dusting of red paprika. The bowl rests on an aged wooden table inside a sunlit stone kitchen in early 1900s Safed, surrounded by the soft shadows of a window frame. In the background, out of focus, sits a woven basket of fresh bread and a clay water jug. The lighting is natural and warm, emphasizing the rich amber and orange hues of the pumpkin against the cool, textured stone walls, capturing the essence of a traditional plant-based Shabbat appetizer."
