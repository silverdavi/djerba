## Instructions

### For Dry M'hamsa

1. **Sauté the Onion:**  
   Finely chop the small onion and sauté in a pot with a little oil until translucent.

2. **Toast the M’hamsa:**  
   Add the semolina flakes (m’hamsa) to the pot and continue sautéing for a few more minutes, stirring, until lightly toasted and aromatic.

3. **Add Water and Cook:**  
   Add water according to package instructions—typically, for each cup of m’hamsa, add 1¼ cups of water. Season with salt to taste.

4. **Simmer:**  
   Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat. Cover and simmer until the water is absorbed and the m’hamsa is tender.

### For M'hamsa with Sauce

1. **Prepare the Base:**  
   Finely chop the small onion and sauté in oil until it begins to caramelize and darken.

2. **Add Seasonings:**  
   Add 1 tablespoon sweet paprika and stir for a few seconds (be careful not to burn the paprika).

3. **Add Tomatoes and Vegetables:**  
   Add a chopped tomato and any vegetables you like (such as carrots, zucchini, potatoes, or bell peppers). Stir to combine.

4. **Season and Add Water:**  
   Sprinkle with salt and black pepper to taste. Pour in boiling water to cover the vegetables.

5. **Simmer:**  
   Let the vegetables cook in the sauce until they begin to soften.

6. **Add the M’hamsa:**  
   Stir in the m’hamsa flakes or pearls.

7. **Cook:**  
   Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Partially cover the pot and simmer until the m’hamsa is cooked through and has absorbed the flavors of the sauce (about 10–15 minutes), stirring occasionally.

**Notes:**
- *M’hamsa* is a traditional hand-rolled semolina pasta, similar to couscous but with larger, irregular pearls. If unavailable, substitute with medium-sized couscous or Israeli couscous, though the texture will differ.
- For enhanced flavor, use homemade vegetable or chicken broth instead of water in the saucy version.
- Traditional Tunisian variations may include chickpeas, pumpkin, or spicy harissa according to taste.
