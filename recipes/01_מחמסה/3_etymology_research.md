# M'hamsa: Etymology, History, and Description

**M'hamsa** (Arabic: محمصة) is a traditional North African couscous variant whose name derives from the Arabic root **ḥ-m-ṣ**, meaning "to toast" or "to roast." The noun form *mḥammaṣa* refers to something that has been toasted—perfectly describing the preparation method of this artisanal pasta. Unlike industrial couscous, m'hamsa is hand-rolled from semolina and water, then sun-dried or lightly toasted to preserve it. The name is a direct reference to this labor-intensive drying process, not a play on *ḥummuṣ* (chickpea), as sometimes mistakenly believed.

Originating in Tunisia, particularly in rural and inland regions, m'hamsa reflects a preservation technique born from necessity: turning durum wheat into a shelf-stable, nutrient-dense staple. Its production often took place communally, with women gathering to roll the semolina into irregular pearls and dry them under the sun. The process allowed families to store large quantities for use year-round.
 
Culinarily, m'hamsa sits at the intersection of couscous and pasta. The grains are larger and more rustic than standard couscous, roughly the size of peppercorns, and they hold their shape well during cooking. Typically steamed or simmered, m'hamsa is often served in broth with vegetables, legumes, or meat—especially lamb or fish. Its nutty, toasted flavor makes it distinct from factory-made couscous and lends it well to both hearty stews and minimalist dishes. M'hamsa continues to be a symbol of Tunisian food heritage, embodying both craftsmanship and resilience.
